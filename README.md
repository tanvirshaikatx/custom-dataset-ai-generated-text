# custom-dataset-ai-generated-text

Custom dataset is designed for binary text classification, distinguishing between AI-generated and human-written content. It contains two features:

text: The input feature consisting of raw text samples.

label: The target variable indicating the class of the text. A value of '0' denotes AI-generated text, while '1' represents human-written text.

This dataset is structured to support supervised machine learning tasks and is suitable for training and evaluating classification models in the context of AI-generated content detection.
