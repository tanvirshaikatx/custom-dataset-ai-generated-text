"The key principles of investing in the stock market are:

Invest for the long term. The stock market can be volatile in the short term, but it has historically trended upwards over the long term. By investing for the long term, you can ride out the short-term fluctuations and potentially earn significant returns on your investment.
Do your research. Before you invest in any stock, it is important to do your research and understand the company's business model, financial health, and competitive landscape. This will help you to make informed investment decisions.
Diversify your portfolio. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. By diversifying your portfolio, you can reduce your overall risk. This means investing in a variety of different stocks from different industries and sectors.
Rebalance your portfolio regularly. As your investments grow and change, it is important to rebalance your portfolio regularly. This means selling some of your winners and buying more of your losers. This will help to maintain your target asset allocation and reduce your overall risk.
Have a plan. It is important to have a plan in place before you start investing. This plan should outline your investment goals, your risk tolerance, and your time horizon. This will help you to make disciplined investment decisions and stay on track with your investment goals.
Here are some additional tips for investing in the stock market:

Start early. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow. This is due to the power of compound interest.
Invest regularly. One of the best ways to invest in the stock market is to invest regularly. This is known as dollar-cost averaging. It allows you to buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.
Don't panic sell. When the stock market takes a downturn, it is important to stay calm and avoid panic selling. Panic selling can lead to you selling your shares at a loss.
Reinvest your dividends. If you invest in dividend-paying stocks, you can reinvest your dividends to buy more shares. This can help your investment grow even faster.
Investing in the stock market can be a great way to build wealth over the long term. However, it is important to understand the risks involved and to invest wisely. By following the key principles above, you can increase your chances of success.",0

"A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity. A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth mean recession, but many use more complex measures to decide if the economy is in recession.",0
"A recession is a significant and sustained economic downturn that typically involves a contraction in economic activity, leading to a decline in various economic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, and consumer spending. Recessions are characterized by a period of negative economic growth and are often accompanied by reduced business activity, increased unemployment, and a decrease in consumer and business confidence.

Key characteristics of a recession include:

Economic Contraction: A recession is marked by a decline in economic output, typically measured by a decrease in GDP for two consecutive quarters (or more). This means that the economy is producing less, and businesses are operating at a reduced capacity.

Increased Unemployment: Recessions are associated with rising unemployment rates as businesses reduce their workforce or freeze hiring due to reduced demand and economic uncertainty. Job losses can have a significant impact on individuals and communities.

Reduced Consumer Spending: During a recession, consumer spending tends to decline as people become more cautious about their finances. This can lead to reduced demand for goods and services, further impacting businesses.

Decreased Business Investment: Businesses often cut back on capital expenditures, including new equipment, expansion, and research and development, during a recession. This contributes to reduced economic activity.

Declining Stock Markets: Stock markets may experience significant declines during recessions, reflecting decreased investor confidence and concerns about corporate profitability.

Lending Constraints: Banks and financial institutions may become more cautious about lending, which can lead to reduced access to credit for individuals and businesses.

Falling Consumer and Business Confidence: A lack of confidence in the economic outlook can lead to decreased consumer and business spending. Negative sentiment can contribute to a self-perpetuating cycle of economic decline.

Recessions can have a wide-ranging impact on individuals, businesses, and governments. Policymakers and central banks often respond to recessions with measures such as monetary policy adjustments (lowering interest rates), fiscal stimulus (government spending and tax cuts), and financial support to stabilize the economy and promote recovery.

The causes of recessions can vary and may include factors such as financial crises, excessive debt levels, external shocks (e.g., natural disasters or geopolitical events), or imbalances in the economy. Recessions are an inherent part of the economic cycle, and periods of economic expansion are typically followed by contractions, with recovery and growth occurring afterward. Accurately identifying and responding to a recession is a significant challenge for policymakers, economists, and financial analysts, and it often requires a coordinated effort to mitigate its impact.

A recession is a significant, pervasive, and persistent decline in economic activity 1. It is generally identified by a fall in GDP in two successive quarters 1. Recessions are usually accompanied by rising unemployment, declining consumer demand, and a bearish stock market 2.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) defines an economic recession as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail salesÃ¢â‚¬Â 3. However, the NBER also says there is Ã¢â‚¬Å“no fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in our decisionsÃ¢â‚¬Â 3.

Recessions can be caused by various factors such as a financial crisis, a natural disaster, or a pandemic 2. Governments around the world have adopted fiscal and monetary policies to prevent a run-of-the-mill recession from becoming far worse 23.",0

Economic shocks: Economic shocks, such as oil price shocks or natural disasters, can also lead to recessions.
Asset bubbles: Asset bubbles, such as the housing bubble in the United States in the early 2000s, can lead to recessions when they burst.
Recessions can have a number of negative consequences, including:

Job losses: Recessions often lead to job losses as businesses cut back on production.
Falling incomes: Job losses and reduced production can lead to falling incomes for individuals and households.
Reduced consumer spending: Reduced incomes can lead to reduced consumer spending, which can further slow down the economy.
Business failures: Recessions can also lead to business failures as companies struggle to survive the economic downturn.
Governments typically implement a variety of policies to try to mitigate the negative effects of recessions. These policies may include:

Fiscal stimulus: Fiscal stimulus involves increasing government spending or cutting taxes to boost the economy.
Monetary policy: Monetary policy involves the central bank adjusting interest rates to try to influence economic activity.

"Norse mythology is a collection of myths and legends that originated in ancient Germania and Scandinavia. It was the primary religion of the European north until the introduction of Christianity in the 8th-12th centuries CE 1. Norse myths likely developed from the Proto-Indo-European mythology of prehistory 1. The body of stories that we today call Ã¢â‚¬Å“Norse mythologyÃ¢â‚¬Â formed one of the centerpieces of the pagan Norse religion 2. These are the tales that Viking poets recited in dimly lit halls to the captivated attendees of grand feasts, and which fathers and mothers told to their children around roaring hearth-fires on long winter nights 2.

The old gods of Norse mythology are separated into two distinct groups: the Ãƒâ€ sir and the Vanir. The Ãƒâ€ sir are the main gods in Norse mythology and live in Asgard. Notable Ãƒâ€ sir include Odin, Thor, Frigg, Heimdall, TÃƒÂ½r, Bragi, IÃƒÂ°unn (Idunn), Baldr, and Loki (though not always). Not much is known about the Vanir other than that they live in Vanaheim 3.

Norse mythology is full of fascinating stories about gods, goddesses, giants, dwarves, elves, and other mythical creatures. Here are some examples:

The Creation Myth: In this myth, Odin and his brothers create the world from the body of a giant named Ymir 4.
The Death of Baldr: This story tells how Baldr, one of the most beloved gods in Asgard, was killed by his blind brother Hodr with a spear made of mistletoe 1.
The Binding of Fenrir: This myth tells how the gods bound Fenrir, a giant wolf who was prophesied to kill Odin during Ragnarok 5.
The Mead of Poetry: This story tells how Odin stole the mead of poetry from a giant named Suttungr 2.
The Nine Worlds: Norse mythology describes nine different worlds that are connected by Yggdrasil, the world tree. These worlds include Asgard (the home of the gods), Midgard (the world of humans), Jotunheim (the world of giants), and Helheim (the underworld) 4.
These are just a few examples of the many fascinating stories that make up Norse mythology.

"The Trojan War definition in history describes a conflict between Mycenaean Greeks and the city of Troy sparked by Paris, son of the King of Troy, abducting Helen, the queen to a Greek Spartan king, and fleeing back to Troy. The story of the Trojan War is a mix of legend and some historical accuracy",0
"The Trojan War is a legendary conflict from Greek mythology, known primarily through the epic poems of the Iliad and the Odyssey, attributed to the ancient Greek poet Homer. The war was fought between the city of Troy and a coalition of Greek states and is believed to have taken place around the 12th century BCE. The story of the Trojan War is a complex and multi-faceted narrative, but here's a summary of the key events:

The Judgement of Paris:
The seeds of the Trojan War were sown when Paris, a prince of Troy, was chosen to arbitrate a dispute among three goddesses: Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena. Each goddess offered him a bribe. Aphrodite promised him the most beautiful mortal woman, Helen, as his wife. Paris chose Aphrodite as the fairest, and this led to his eventual elopement with Helen, who was already married to Menelaus, the king of Sparta.

The Abduction of Helen:
Paris and Helen fled to Troy, causing outrage and prompting the Greek kings to assemble an army to retrieve Helen and exact revenge on the Trojans. This coalition of Greek forces was led by Agamemnon, Menelaus' brother and the king of Mycenae. Notable Greek heroes and warriors, such as Achilles, Odysseus, and Ajax, joined the expedition.

The Ten-Year Siege:
The Greeks laid siege to the city of Troy for ten long years. The war involved numerous battles, heroic feats, and divine interventions on both sides. The gods and goddesses of Greek mythology played a significant role in the conflict, often meddling in the affairs of mortals.

Achilles and Hector:
Two central figures in the war were Achilles, the Greek hero known for his invulnerability except for his heel, and Hector, the greatest Trojan warrior. The Iliad tells of their epic duel, which ended in Hector's death.

The Trojan Horse:
The war reached its climax when the Greeks devised a cunning plan to infiltrate the seemingly impregnable city of Troy. They built a giant wooden horse, the ""Trojan Horse,"" left it at the gates of the city as a supposed offering, and pretended to sail away. The Trojans, believing it to be a gift, brought the horse inside their walls. Unbeknownst to them, Greek soldiers were concealed inside the horse.

The Fall of Troy:
At night, the Greek soldiers emerged from the horse, opened the city gates, and allowed the Greek army, which had returned under the cover of darkness, to enter the city. Troy was sacked and destroyed, and its treasures were plundered. The city went up in flames, and many Trojans were killed or enslaved.

The Return of the Greek Heroes:
Following the fall of Troy, the Greek heroes faced various trials and tribulations on their journey home. The adventures of some of these heroes are chronicled in the Odyssey.

The Death of Achilles:
Achilles, one of the central figures of the war, met his death when he was shot in the heel, the only vulnerable spot on his body, by Paris with the help of Apollo.

The story of the Trojan War has inspired countless works of literature, art, and drama over the centuries. It explores themes of heroism, fate, the consequences of human actions, and the interaction between mortals and gods in ancient Greek culture. The war's aftermath, including the homecoming of the Greek heroes, is chronicled in the Odyssey, another epic poem attributed to Homer.

"The Trojan War is a legendary conflict between the early Greeks and the people of Troy in western Anatolia, dated by later Greek authors to the 12th or 13th century BCE 12. The war was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans (Greeks) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta 13. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology, and it has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably HomerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Iliad 1. The core of the Iliad (Books II Ã¢â‚¬â€œ XXIII) describes a period of four days and two nights in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the Odyssey describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heroes 1. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments 1.

The Trojan War is believed to have been a historical event by many scholars, though there is no single authoritative text that tells the entire events of the war 1. The ancient Greeks believed that Troy was located near the Dardanelles and that the Trojan War was a historical event of the 13th or 12th century BCE 1. By the mid-19th century CE, both the war and the city were widely seen as non-historical, but in 1868, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert, who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at what is now Hisarlik in Turkey. On the basis of excavations conducted by Schliemann and others, this claim is now accepted by most scholars 1.

The story has been retold in many different forms, including books, movies, and television shows. Some notable works include Wolfgang PetersenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Troy,Ã¢â‚¬Â David BenioffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Game of Thrones,Ã¢â‚¬Â and Madeline MillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Song of AchillesÃ¢â‚¬Â 4.",0

The story of the Trojan War is one of the most famous and enduring legends in Western culture. It is a story of love, betrayal, war, and heroism.

The war began when the Trojan prince Paris abducted Helen, the wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Menelaus called upon his brother Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae, to help him get Helen back. Agamemnon assembled a vast army of Greek warriors and sailed to Troy to begin the war.

The war lasted for ten years, and many heroes on both sides were killed. Some of the most famous Greek heroes who fought in the war include Achilles, Odysseus, Ajax, and Diomedes. Some of the most famous Trojan heroes who fought in the war include Hector, Paris, and Aeneas.

The war finally ended when the Greeks used a trick to deceive the Trojans. They built a giant wooden horse and left it outside the gates of Troy. The Trojans thought the horse was a gift from the gods and brought it inside the city walls. At night, Greek soldiers hidden inside the horse emerged and opened the city gates to the rest of the Greek army. The Greeks then sacked the city of Troy and killed many of its inhabitants.

"Ra, also spelled Re, is one of the most significant and revered deities in ancient Egyptian mythology. He is often considered the sun god and the creator of the world, and his significance is profound in Egyptian religious beliefs and cosmology. Here are some key aspects of the significance of the Egyptian god Ra:

Solar Deity: Ra is most commonly associated with the sun. He was believed to travel across the sky in a solar barque during the day, providing light and warmth to the world. The sun, as a life-giving force, was essential for the survival of crops, animals, and humans, and Ra's role as the sun god made him central to Egyptian life.

Creation Myth: In some Egyptian creation myths, Ra is considered the creator of the world. He brought order and life into existence from the primordial chaos. Ra was said to have created all other deities, including gods and goddesses, through his thoughts or by speaking their names.

Supreme Deity: At different times in Egyptian history, Ra was considered the supreme deity and the king of the gods. His prominence and power in Egyptian theology made him a unifying force in the pantheon.

Association with Pharaohs: The pharaohs of ancient Egypt were often believed to be the earthly manifestations of Ra, which legitimized their rule and linked them to divine authority. Pharaohs were sometimes referred to as ""The Son of Ra.""

Symbolism: Ra was often depicted with a solar disk on his head and a cobra coiled around the disk, which was a symbol of his protective power. He was sometimes portrayed as a falcon-headed deity, representing the sky and the sun.

Daily Cycle: Ra's journey across the sky represented the daily cycle of the sun, and his nightly journey through the underworld was seen as a perilous journey of rebirth, symbolizing the eternal cycle of life, death, and renewal.

Amun-Ra: In later Egyptian history, Ra was sometimes combined with the god Amun to form Amun-Ra, a deity that was even more powerful and influential. Amun-Ra was widely worshiped in the New Kingdom period and was associated with the pharaoh's divine authority.

Temples and Worship: Temples dedicated to Ra were built throughout ancient Egypt, with the most famous being the city of Heliopolis, known as the ""City of the Sun."" Ra's worship was a fundamental part of the Egyptian religious landscape.

Mythological Roles: Ra played various mythological roles, such as his nightly battle with the serpent Apophis, who sought to prevent the sun from rising. These myths symbolized the ongoing struggle between order and chaos.

Ra's significance in Egyptian religion evolved over time, and his worship endured for thousands of years. The god Ra embodies the vital role of the sun in ancient Egyptian life, from sustenance and agriculture to cosmology and divine authority.

"Ra is an ancient Egyptian deity of the sun, creation, law, light, order, fertility, and growth 123. He was one of the most important gods in ancient Egyptian religion and was believed to have created everything 3. Ra was also known as the first pharaoh of Ancient Egypt 123. He was portrayed as a falcon and shared characteristics with the sky-god Horus 1. At times, the two deities were merged as Ra-Horakhty, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ra, who is Horus of the Two HorizonsÃ¢â‚¬Â 1.

Ra was believed to have ruled in all parts of the created world: the sky, the Earth, and the underworld 1. He was said to travel across the sky in his falcon-headed form on the Mandjet Barque through the hours of the day and then switch to the Mesektet Barque in his ram-headed form to descend into the underworld for the hours of the night 1. According to Egyptian myth, when Ra became too old and weary to reign on Earth he relinquished and went to the skies. As the Sun god one of his duties was to carry the Sun cross the sky on his solar barque to light the day. But when the sun set and twilight came he and his vessel passes through the akhet, the horizon, in the west, and travels to the underworld. At times, the horizon is described as a gate or door that leads to Duat. There he would have to sail on the subterrestrial Nile and cross through twelve gates and regions. On course of underworld journey he transformed into his Ram headed form. Every night Apophis attempted to attack Ra and stop sun-boatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey. After defeating snake Ra would leave underworld returning emerging at dawn lighting day again 1.",0
"
Ra was the most important god in the Egyptian pantheon. He was the sun god, the creator god, and the king of the gods. He was also the god of light, warmth, and life.

Ra was believed to be the creator of the universe. He emerged from the primordial waters of chaos and created the world from his body. He was also the father of many other gods and goddesses, including Osiris, Isis, and Horus.

Ra was worshipped throughout Egypt, and his temples were among the largest and most elaborate in the country. He was also depicted in many works of art, including statues, paintings, and reliefs.

Ra was a powerful and benevolent god. He was seen as the protector of Egypt and its people. He was also the source of all life and goodness.

Here are some of the reasons why Ra was so significant to the ancient Egyptians:

He was the creator and sustainer of all life.
He was the source of light and warmth, which were essential for agriculture and other aspects of Egyptian life.
He was the king of the gods and the protector of Egypt.
He was a symbol of hope and renewal.
The ancient Egyptians believed that Ra's journey across the sky each day was a metaphor for the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. They also believed that Ra would defeat the forces of chaos and darkness at the end of time, and that he would lead the righteous to a new and better world.

Ra's significance to the ancient Egyptians is evident in the many ways in which he was worshipped and depicted. He was the most important god in the Egyptian pantheon, and his influence can still be seen today in Egyptian culture and art.",0

"Lord Shiva is one of the principal deities in Hinduism and is a complex and multifaceted god with various roles and attributes. He is one of the three primary deities of the Hindu trinity, alongside Brahma (the creator) and Vishnu (the preserver). Shiva is often associated with destruction, but his role goes beyond that, as he represents various aspects of existence and spirituality. Here are some key aspects of Lord Shiva:

The Destroyer and Transformer: Shiva is often referred to as ""The Destroyer"" because he represents the aspect of the divine that brings about the dissolution of the universe. However, this destruction is not malevolent but rather a necessary aspect of the cosmic cycle, allowing for renewal and transformation.

The Ascetic and Yogi: Shiva is often depicted as an ascetic who meditates in the Himalayas. He is a symbol of detachment from material desires and worldly attachments. He is also considered the ""Adi Yogi,"" or the ""First Yogi,"" who taught yoga and meditation to humanity.

The Creator: While Shiva is primarily associated with destruction, he is also associated with creation. He is sometimes depicted as ""Ardhanarishvara,"" a half-male and half-female form, symbolizing the union of the masculine and feminine aspects of the divine, which is essential for creation.

Nataraja - The Cosmic Dancer: Shiva is often depicted as Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance. This form of Shiva symbolizes the continuous cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction, with his dance representing the rhythm of the universe.

The God of Time: Shiva is also associated with the concept of time, as ""Mahakala,"" the Great Time. He is often depicted with a serpent around his neck, symbolizing time's inexorable passage.

Family Life: Shiva is married to Parvati (also known as Shakti or Devi), who is the goddess of power, love, and devotion. Their sons are Ganesha and Kartikeya. The family life of Shiva represents the balance of asceticism and domestic life.

Trident and Third Eye: Shiva is often depicted with a trident (trishul) and a third eye. The trident symbolizes his power to destroy, create, and preserve, while the third eye represents his insight and knowledge.

Blue Throat: Shiva is also known as ""Neelkanth"" or ""The Blue Throated One."" According to a myth, he drank the poison that emerged during the churning of the cosmic ocean, saving the world but turning his throat blue in the process.

Worship and Festivals: Shiva is widely worshiped in Hinduism, and there are numerous temples and pilgrimage sites dedicated to him. The most significant festival dedicated to Shiva is Maha Shivaratri, which celebrates his marriage to Parvati and his cosmic dance.

Shiva's diverse attributes make him a complex and revered deity in Hinduism. He is associated with concepts of creation, preservation, and destruction, as well as meditation, yoga, and asceticism. Devotees of Shiva often seek his blessings for spiritual insight, wisdom, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

"Native American myths and legends are stories of lore that reflect the culture, beliefs, and imagination of the First Nations peoples of North America 1. They feature a variety of characters, themes, and regions, from creation myths and heroic journeys to tricksters and monsters. They are part of an oral tradition that passes on survival knowledge, traditions, and spiritual insights from one generation to the next 1. These stories can be found in different forms of media, such as books, artworks, and online sources.

There is no single mythology of the Indigenous North American peoples, but numerous different canons of traditional narratives associated with religion, ethics, and beliefs 2. Such stories are deeply based in nature and are rich with the symbolism of seasons, weather, plants, animals, earth, water, fire, sky, and the heavenly bodies 2. Common elements are the principle of an all-embracing, universal and omniscient Great Spirit, a connection to the Earth and its landscapes, a belief in a parallel world in the sky (sometimes also underground and/or below the water), diverse creation narratives, visits to the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœland of the deadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and collective memories of ancient sacred ancestors 2. A characteristic of many of the myths is the close relationship between human beings and animals (including birds and reptiles). They often feature shape-shifting between animal and human form. Marriage between people and different species (particularly bears) is a common theme. In some stories, animals foster human children. Although most Native North American myths are profound and serious, some use light-hearted humor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ often in the form of tricksters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to entertain as they subtly convey important spiritual and moral messages. The use of allegory is common, exploring issues ranging from love and friendship to domestic violence and mental illness 32.

Most of these myths were first transcribed by ethnologists during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These sources were collected from Native American elders who still had strong connections to the traditions of their ancestors. They may be considered the most authentic surviving records of ancient stories 2.",0

"Existentialism is the philosophical belief we are each responsible for creating purpose or meaning in our own lives. Our individual purpose and meaning is not given to us by Gods, governments, teachers or other authorities",0
"Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, primarily in Europe, and it focuses on exploring the nature of human existence, freedom, choice, and the often confronting experience of individual existence. Existentialism is not a unified or systematic philosophy but rather a diverse set of ideas and perspectives, with various existentialist thinkers offering their own interpretations. However, there are several key themes that are often associated with existentialism:

Existence Precedes Essence: Existentialists often assert that individuals are born without predetermined meaning or purpose. In contrast to the idea that people have a predefined essence or nature, existentialists believe that one's existence precedes any essence. This means that individuals are responsible for creating their own meanings and values in life through their choices and actions.

Freedom and Choice: Existentialism emphasizes the fundamental importance of individual freedom and choice. Existentialists contend that people have the freedom to make choices, even in the face of a potentially indifferent or absurd universe. However, this freedom is accompanied by the responsibility for the consequences of those choices.

Angst or Existential Anxiety: Existentialist thinkers often explore the concept of ""angst"" or existential anxiety. This refers to the emotional and psychological discomfort that arises when individuals confront the absurdity and apparent meaninglessness of existence. Facing the void and the need to make choices can be deeply unsettling.

Absurdity of Life: Existentialists often highlight the idea that the world can appear absurd or irrational. They suggest that life lacks inherent meaning, and individuals must confront this lack of inherent purpose.

Authenticity: Existentialism encourages individuals to live authentically, which means being true to oneself and one's values, even in the face of societal expectations and pressures. Authenticity often involves making choices that align with one's own beliefs rather than conforming to external norms.

Existential Isolation: Existentialist philosophy acknowledges the fundamental sense of isolation and separateness that individuals often experience. While people can connect with others, they still exist as distinct and unique beings with their own experiences and perspectives.

Death and Mortality: Existentialism often addresses the human awareness of mortality and the significance of death in shaping the human experience. The finite nature of life underscores the urgency of making meaningful choices.

Prominent existentialist philosophers include Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Friedrich Nietzsche, SÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard, and Martin Heidegger. Each of these thinkers had their own take on existentialist themes and made unique contributions to the philosophy. Existentialism has also influenced various fields beyond philosophy, including literature, psychology, and the arts.

Existentialism's emphasis on individuality, freedom, and the responsibility to create meaning has had a lasting impact on discussions of ethics, personal identity, and the human condition. It remains a significant and influential philosophical perspective in contemporary thought.

"Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, choice, and responsibility in an irrational universe 1. It is the view that humans define their own meaning in life and morality without relying on any transcendent force, religion, or authority 1. Existentialism is opposed to essentialism, which is the belief that there is a fixed nature or essence to things 1.

Existentialist philosophers explore questions related to the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence 2. They believe that humans are free to make choices and shape their own lives, but that this freedom comes with a sense of anxiety and dread 2. Some of the key themes of existentialist thought include authenticity, freedom, situatedness, irrationality/absurdity, and anxiety in the face of an absurd world 3.

Some of the most important existentialist philosophers include SÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Simone de Beauvoir 3. These thinkers explored questions related to the nature of existence, the role of the individual in society, and the search for meaning in life.",0
"
Existentialism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and responsibility in an absurd world. Existentialist philosophers believe that humans are not born with any innate meaning or purpose, and that each individual is responsible for creating their own meaning in life.

Existentialists also believe that humans are constantly faced with difficult choices, and that there is no right or wrong answer to many of the important questions in life. This can lead to a sense of anxiety and dread, but existentialists argue that it is also what makes life meaningful and exciting.

Some of the key themes of existentialism include:

Individual freedom and responsibility: Existentialists believe that humans are free to choose their own path in life, but that this freedom also comes with responsibility. We are responsible for our own choices and actions, and we cannot blame others for our failures.
The absurdity of the world: Existentialists believe that the world is an absurd place, and that there is no inherent meaning or purpose in life. This can lead to a sense of anxiety and dread, but it can also motivate us to create our own meaning and purpose.
Authenticity: Existentialists believe that it is important to live authentically, meaning that we should be true to ourselves and our values. We should not try to live a life that is dictated by others or by societal expectations.
Some of the most famous existentialist philosophers include:

SÃƒÂ¸ren Kierkegaard
Friedrich Nietzsche
Albert Camus
Jean-Paul Sartre
Simone de Beauvoir
Existentialism has had a significant influence on many different fields, including literature, art, film, and psychology. It is a philosophy that can help us to understand the challenges and opportunities of human existence.

Here are some examples of existentialist ideas in popular culture:

In the novel Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky, the protagonist Raskolnikov tries to justify his crime by arguing that he is above the law. However, he ultimately comes to realize that he is responsible for his actions and that he must accept the consequences.
In the film The Matrix by the Wachowskis, the protagonist Neo discovers that the world he lives in is actually a computer simulation. He must then choose whether to remain in the simulation or to fight for his freedom.
In the video game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the protagonist Link is tasked with finding the Master Sword and defeating the evil Calamity Ganon. However, he is free to explore the vast open world and complete side quests at his own pace.
Existentialism is a complex and challenging philosophy, but it is also a deeply rewarding one. It can help us to understand ourselves and the world around us in new ways.",0
"Utilitarianism is a theory of morality that advocates actions that foster happiness and oppose actions that cause unhappiness. Utilitarianism promotes ""the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people.""",0
"Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that evaluates the moral worth of actions based on their consequences, specifically the principle of ""the greatest good for the greatest number."" It is a consequentialist and utilitarian ethical framework that assesses the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering the overall happiness or well-being it produces for the majority of affected individuals.

Key concepts and principles of utilitarianism include:

Hedonistic Calculus: Utilitarianism often measures happiness or pleasure and the absence of suffering or pain as the central criteria for evaluating the consequences of actions. This can be quantified using a ""hedonistic calculus"" to calculate the net utility of an action. Factors to consider include the intensity, duration, certainty, and propinquity (nearness) of pleasure or pain.

The Greatest Happiness Principle: This is the fundamental principle of utilitarianism, emphasizing that an action is morally right if it produces the greatest overall happiness when compared to all available alternatives. In other words, the morally preferable option is the one that maximizes overall well-being.

Consequentialism: Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory, meaning it focuses exclusively on the outcomes or consequences of actions. It does not take into account the motives or intentions behind actions. If an action leads to more happiness than suffering, it is considered morally right, regardless of the agent's intentions.

Impartiality: Utilitarianism requires that all individuals affected by an action be considered impartially. It is concerned with the well-being of all sentient beings, and no one's happiness should be given greater weight or priority based on personal preferences, relationships, or biases.

Act and Rule Utilitarianism: There are two main forms of utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism assesses each individual action based on its consequences, while rule utilitarianism evaluates the moral rightness of actions by considering adherence to general rules that, if consistently followed, would produce the greatest overall happiness. Rule utilitarianism often provides practical guidance in cases where calculating the consequences of each specific action is impractical.

Utility and Aggregation: Utilitarianism aggregates the happiness or well-being of all individuals affected by an action. It often involves difficult trade-offs and calculations, as it aims to maximize total utility without necessarily guaranteeing that each individual's happiness is maximized.

Critiques and challenges to utilitarianism include concerns about potential injustice to minority interests, issues with quantifying and comparing happiness, and the moral acceptability of certain actions that may produce the greatest happiness for the majority but harm a minority.

Prominent utilitarian philosophers include Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick. John Stuart Mill's version of utilitarianism, often referred to as ""Mill's Utilitarianism,"" is particularly influential and is frequently studied in the context of ethical philosophy. It emphasizes higher and lower pleasures and the importance of individual rights and liberty.

"Utilitarianism is an ethical theory that judges actions based on their consequences 1. It holds that the most ethical choice is the one that will produce the greatest good for the greatest number of people 1. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, which is a general doctrine in ethics that actions should be evaluated based on their consequences 2. The theory aims to foster happiness and well-being and to oppose unhappiness and pain for all affected individuals 1.

The concept of utilitarianism was developed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, two English philosophers from the 18th and 19th centuries 1. They believed that the moral worth of an action should be judged by its ability to promote happiness or pleasure and to minimize pain or suffering 1. According to utilitarianism, an action is right if it tends to promote happiness or pleasure and wrong if it tends to produce unhappiness or pain, not just for the performer of the action but also for everyone else affected by it 2.

Utilitarianism has been influential in many areas of ethics, including bioethics, environmental ethics, and business ethics. However, it has also been criticized for its inability to account for individual rights and its tendency to justify actions that are morally questionable 3.",0

Utilitarianism is a normative ethical theory that judges the morality of an action based on its consequences. Utilitarians believe that the right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

The concept of utilitarianism was first developed by the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham in the 18th century. Bentham argued that the right action is the one that maximizes happiness and minimizes suffering. He developed a system for calculating the utility of an action, which he called the felicific calculus.

The felicific calculus takes into account the following factors:

The intensity of the pleasure or pain
The duration of the pleasure or pain
The certainty or uncertainty of the pleasure or pain
The propinquity or remoteness of the pleasure or pain
The fecundity or purity of the pleasure or pain
The extent or catholicity of the pleasure or pain
Utilitarians believe that we should always act in a way that maximizes the utility of our actions. This means that we should always choose the action that we believe will produce the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory, which means that it judges the morality of an action based on its consequences. Other consequentialist ethical theories include hedonism, which judges the morality of an action based on whether it produces pleasure or pain, and egoism, which judges the morality of an action based on whether it benefits the individual acting.

Utilitarianism has been criticized for a number of reasons. One criticism is that it is difficult to calculate the utility of an action. Another criticism is that utilitarianism can lead to morally questionable actions, such as sacrificing the few for the good of the many.

Despite these criticisms, utilitarianism remains a popular ethical theory. It is a useful framework for thinking about the morality of our actions and for making decisions that will benefit society as a whole.

Here are some examples of utilitarianism in practice:

A doctor may choose to perform a risky surgery on a patient, even though the patient has a low chance of survival, because the surgery could save the lives of many other patients.
A government may choose to raise taxes on the wealthy in order to fund social programs that benefit the poor.
A company may choose to invest in renewable energy sources, even though they are more expensive than fossil fuels, because they believe that this will benefit the environment in the long run.
These are just a few examples of how utilitarianism can be used to make decisions that have a positive impact on society.",0
"Plato uses the cave as a symbolic representation of how human beings live in the world, contrasting reality versus our interpretation of it. These two ideas reflect the two worlds in the story: the world inside the cave, and the world outside.",0
"Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"" is a symbolic story found in Book VII of his work ""The Republic."" It serves as an extended metaphor that illustrates key aspects of Plato's philosophy, particularly his ideas about reality, knowledge, and the nature of human existence.

In the allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have been imprisoned in a dark cave since birth. These individuals are chained in such a way that they can only see the wall in front of them and the shadows of objects behind them. These shadows are cast by a fire behind the prisoners, which they cannot see. The prisoners are completely unaware of the outside world, and they mistake the shadows for reality.

The allegory then describes the process of enlightenment and philosophical awakening. It begins when one of the prisoners is freed and exposed to the outside world. Initially, the bright sunlight outside the cave blinds the freed prisoner, causing pain and confusion. However, as the person's eyes adjust to the light, they gradually come to understand that the shadows in the cave were mere illusions, and the real world outside the cave is the true reality.

The freed prisoner then feels compelled to return to the cave to rescue their fellow prisoners and share the knowledge of the outside world. However, the other prisoners, having never experienced anything but the shadows, do not believe the freed prisoner's account of reality and resist being unchained.

The allegory of the cave has several layers of meaning:

Illusion vs. Reality: The prisoners in the cave represent those who live their lives in ignorance, believing the physical world they see and experience to be the only reality. The shadows on the cave wall symbolize the illusions and opinions that can deceive people about what is true and real.

The World of Forms: Plato believed in a world of perfect, unchanging forms or ideas that exist independently of the physical world. The world outside the cave represents the realm of these perfect forms, which philosophers, through reason and intellectual inquiry, can access and understand.

The Philosopher-King: The freed prisoner who returns to the cave symbolizes the philosopher who has gained insight into the world of forms and possesses knowledge and wisdom. In ""The Republic,"" Plato suggests that philosopher-kings should rule the state because they have the capacity to understand the true nature of reality and make just decisions.

Education and Enlightenment: The allegory emphasizes the importance of education and the transformative power of knowledge. It illustrates the idea that individuals can be liberated from ignorance and brought into a deeper understanding of reality through philosophical inquiry and learning.

Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"" is a powerful metaphor that continues to be discussed and interpreted in various fields, including philosophy, psychology, and education. It raises questions about the nature of truth, the role of perception and knowledge, and the possibility of enlightenment and personal transformation.",0
"The Allegory of the Cave is a story from Book VII of PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“RepublicÃ¢â‚¬Â that explores the nature of knowledge and its sources 1. It is a dialogue between PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates. The story compares the effect of education and the lack of it on our nature and distinguishes between people who mistake sensory knowledge for the truth and people who really do see the truth 1.

The story involves prisoners who have lived their entire lives chained inside a cave, only seeing shadows of objects projected by a fire 2. They believe that these shadows are the most real things in the world, and when they talk to one another about Ã¢â‚¬Å“men,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“women,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“trees,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“horses,Ã¢â‚¬Â and so on, they refer only to these shadows 2. One of these prisoners is freed from his bonds and is able to look at the fire and at the statues themselves. After initial pain and disbelief, he eventually realizes that all these things are more real than the shadows he has always believed to be the most real things; he grasps how the fire and the statues together caused the shadows, which are copies of the real things. He now takes the statues and fire as the most real things in the world. Next, this prisoner is dragged out of the cave into the world above. At first, he is so dazzled by the light in the open that he can only look at shadows, then he is able to look at reflections, then finally at the real objectsÃ¢â‚¬â€real trees, flowers, houses, and other physical objects. He sees that these are even more real than the statues were, and that those objects were only copies of these. Finally, when the prisonerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes have fully adjusted to the brightness, he lifts his sights toward the heavens and looks at the sun. He understands that the sun is the cause of everything he sees around himÃ¢â‚¬â€of the light, of his capacity for sight, of the existence of flowers, trees, and all other objects 2.

The allegory has been interpreted in many different ways over time. Some see it as a metaphor for education and enlightenment, while others see it as a commentary on human nature or political philosophy 3. Regardless of interpretation, it remains one of PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most famous works.",0

The Allegory of the Cave is a philosophical concept presented by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work Republic (514aÃ¢â‚¬â€œ520a) to compare ""the effect of education (Ãâ‚¬ÃŽÂ±ÃŽÂ¹ÃŽÂ´ÃŽÂµÃŽÂ¯ÃŽÂ±) and the lack of it on our nature"". It is written as a dialogue between Plato's brother Glaucon and his mentor Socrates, narrated by the latter. The allegory is presented after the analogy of the sun (508bÃ¢â‚¬â€œ509c) and the analogy of the divided line (509dÃ¢â‚¬â€œ511e).

In the allegory, Plato describes a group of prisoners who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The prisoners watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them, and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows. According to Plato's theory of Forms, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall do not make up reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners.

The Allegory of the Cave can be interpreted in many ways, but some of the most common interpretations include:

The role of education: The allegory can be seen as a metaphor for the role of education in opening our minds to the world around us. Just as the prisoners in the cave are only able to see shadows of reality, we are all limited in our understanding of the world by our own experiences and biases. Education can help us to break free from these limitations and to see the world more clearly.
The nature of reality: The allegory can also be seen as a meditation on the nature of reality. Plato believed that the true reality exists beyond the world of our senses, and that the physical world is just a shadow of the true reality. The allegory teaches us that we should not be deceived by the appearances of the physical world, but should seek to understand the true reality that lies beyond.
The importance of philosophy: The philosopher in the allegory represents the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. Just as the philosopher is able to escape from the cave and see the true reality, philosophy can help us to escape from the limitations of our own minds and to see the world more clearly.
The Allegory of the Cave is a powerful and complex metaphor that continues to be relevant today. It is a reminder of the importance of education, the limits of our perception, and the power of philosophy.",0
"The three key concepts of Confucianism include: humanity, duty, ritual. The Confucian worldview includes many ideas and principles but these offer a starting point. The chapter recognizes Daoism's playful ambiguity and discusses the three concepts: Way (Dao), integrity (de), and non-action (wuwei).",0
"Confucianism is a philosophical and ethical system that originated in ancient China, developed by the Chinese philosopher Confucius (Kong Fuzi) and later elaborated upon by his followers. It has had a profound and lasting influence on Chinese culture and society. The key ideas of Confucianism include:

Ren (Ã¤Â»Â) - Benevolence and Humanity: Ren is the central virtue in Confucianism. It refers to the quality of compassion, kindness, and benevolence. Confucius emphasized the importance of cultivating one's own humanity and treating others with compassion and respect. Ren is central to the idea of harmonious human relationships.

Li (Ã§Â¤Â¼) - Ritual and Propriety: Li encompasses the idea of ritual, propriety, etiquette, and social norms. It emphasizes the importance of proper conduct, manners, and rituals in both individual behavior and social interactions. Li provides a framework for maintaining social harmony and order.

Xiao (Ã¥Â­Â) - Filial Piety: Xiao is the concept of filial piety or respect and devotion to one's parents and ancestors. It is considered one of the fundamental virtues in Confucianism and is seen as the foundation of social ethics. Filial piety extends to the reverence of one's ancestors.

Yi (Ã¤Â¹â€°) - Righteousness and Justice: Yi involves doing what is right and just. It includes the idea of moral integrity, fulfilling one's duties and responsibilities, and seeking justice for oneself and others. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of adhering to ethical principles.

Zhi (Ã¦â„¢Âº) - Wisdom and Knowledge: Wisdom and knowledge are valued in Confucianism. The pursuit of wisdom through learning and self-improvement is seen as a path to becoming a better person and contributing to society. Education is highly regarded.

Xin (Ã¤Â¿Â¡) - Honesty and Trustworthiness: Xin emphasizes the importance of honesty, sincerity, and trustworthiness. It relates to the idea of keeping one's word, being truthful, and building trust in relationships.

Junzi (Ã¥Ââ€ºÃ¥Â­Â) - The Superior Person or Gentleman: The junzi is an ideal that Confucius admired and encouraged. It refers to an individual of noble character and moral integrity who embodies the virtues of Confucianism. Junzi are morally upright and exhibit wisdom, courage, and humility.

The Five Relationships: Confucianism emphasizes the importance of harmonious social relationships, particularly those between ruler and subject, parent and child, husband and wife, elder and younger siblings, and friend and friend. Maintaining proper conduct in these relationships is crucial for social harmony.

Meritocracy and Social Mobility: Confucianism encourages a society based on merit and capability. It emphasizes the idea that individuals should be promoted and rewarded based on their abilities rather than social status or background. This concept has had a significant impact on the Chinese civil service system.

Cultivation of Virtue: Confucianism stresses self-cultivation and the ongoing pursuit of virtuous character. Individuals are encouraged to continually strive for self-improvement and moral development.

Ancestor Veneration: Ancestor worship and veneration play a significant role in Confucian tradition. Honoring one's ancestors is considered a moral duty, and rituals are conducted to show respect and gratitude to one's forebears.

Confucianism has profoundly shaped Chinese culture, ethics, politics, and education for over two millennia. It provides a framework for understanding personal morality, social order, and governance, and its principles continue to influence East Asian societies to this day.

"Confucianism is a philosophical and ethical system that originated in China during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE) 1. It is based on the teachings of Confucius, a Chinese philosopher who lived from 551 to 479 BCE 2. Confucianism emphasizes the importance of moral values, social order, and respect for authority 2. Here are some of the key ideas of Confucianism:

Ren: This is the central Confucian virtue, often translated as Ã¢â‚¬Å“benevolenceÃ¢â‚¬Â or Ã¢â‚¬Å“humaneness.Ã¢â‚¬Â It refers to the quality of being kind, compassionate, and empathetic toward others 2.
Li: This refers to the set of rituals, customs, and rules that govern social behavior in Confucianism. It includes concepts such as respect for elders, filial piety, and proper conduct in relationships 2.
Xiao: This is the Confucian concept of filial piety, or respect for oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents and ancestors 2.
Junzi: This refers to the ideal person in Confucianism, someone who embodies the virtues of Ren and Li and who is committed to self-improvement and moral excellence 2.
Zhong: This refers to loyalty and devotion to oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family, friends, and community 1.

Confucianism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of social harmony and individual morality. It was founded by the Chinese philosopher Confucius in the 6th century BC, and it has had a profound influence on Chinese culture and society for centuries.

The key ideas of Confucianism include:

Ren (Ã¤Â»Â): Ren is a Chinese word that is often translated as ""benevolence"" or ""humanity."" It is the central concept in Confucianism, and it refers to the ideal way of living in harmony with others.
Li (Ã§Â¦Â®): Li is a Chinese word that is often translated as ""ritual"" or ""propriety."" It refers to the social norms and customs that govern human behavior. Confucians believe that li is essential for maintaining social order and harmony.
Xiao (Ã¥Â­Â): Xiao is a Chinese word that is often translated as ""filial piety."" It refers to the duty of children to respect and obey their parents. Confucians believe that xiao is the foundation of a harmonious society.
Yi (Ã§Â¾Â©): Yi is a Chinese word that is often translated as ""righteousness"" or ""justice."" It refers to the moral code that Confucians believe all people should follow.
Confucius believed that everyone has the potential to be a good person, and that society can be improved by teaching people to live according to the Confucian ideals of ren, li, xiao, and yi.

Confucianism has been praised for its emphasis on social harmony, individual morality, and education. However, it has also been criticized for its conservatism and its sometimes rigid social hierarchy.

Here are some examples of how Confucianism is applied in everyday life:

A child may obey their parents even if they disagree with them, out of respect for xiao.
A student may study diligently in order to become a good citizen and to contribute to society.
A businessperson may treat their employees fairly and with respect, out of a sense of ren.
A politician may make decisions that benefit the people as a whole, even if it means sacrificing their own personal interests, out of a sense of yi.
Confucianism is a complex and sophisticated philosophy that has had a profound influence on Chinese culture and society. It is a philosophy that can teach us how to live better lives in harmony with others.",0
"The Stoics are especially known for teaching that ""virtue is the only good"" for human beings, and that external things, such as health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora) but have value as ""material for virtue to act upon"".",0
"Stoicism is a Hellenistic philosophical school that originated in ancient Greece and became influential in the Roman Empire. It offers a systematic approach to ethics, personal well-being, and understanding the natural world. The central tenets of Stoicism include:

Virtue as the Highest Good: Stoicism teaches that the highest good in life is virtue, often referred to as ""arete"" in Greek. Virtue encompasses qualities like wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. According to Stoicism, one should strive to cultivate these virtues and make them the primary focus of life.

Indifference to External Events: Stoicism distinguishes between things that are within an individual's control (e.g., one's thoughts, values, and actions) and things that are beyond one's control (e.g., external circumstances, other people's opinions, and natural events). Stoics advocate focusing on what is within one's control and accepting with equanimity the things that are not.

The Dichotomy of Control: The concept of the dichotomy of control is central to Stoicism. It encourages individuals to differentiate between things they can control (virtue and inner qualities) and things they cannot control (external events and the actions of others). By focusing on what they can control, Stoics aim to maintain inner peace and resilience in the face of adversity.

Endurance and Resilience: Stoicism emphasizes the importance of enduring hardship and adversity with courage and fortitude. The Stoic motto ""Amor fati"" (love of fate) encourages acceptance of one's circumstances, even if they are difficult, and finding meaning and growth through challenges.

Apathy vs. Tranquility: Stoicism is often mischaracterized as advocating apathy, which means indifference to all emotions. In reality, Stoics seek emotional tranquility or ""ataraxia"" by minimizing irrational and destructive emotions, such as fear, anger, and excessive desire. They aim to achieve a balanced emotional state guided by reason.

Logos and Rationality: Stoicism incorporates the concept of ""logos,"" which refers to the rational, universal order of the cosmos. Stoics believe that humans have the capacity for reason and that living in accordance with reason is essential for virtuous living.

Impartiality and Justice: Stoicism underscores the importance of treating all people with fairness and impartiality. It promotes a sense of cosmopolitanism, where individuals view themselves as members of a global community, emphasizing the value of justice and fairness for all.

Mindfulness and Self-Examination: Stoics practice self-examination and mindfulness to better understand their values, thoughts, and behavior. They use techniques such as journaling and self-reflection to improve their character and actions.

Memento Mori: Stoicism incorporates the idea of ""memento mori,"" a reminder of one's mortality. This reminder is intended to encourage individuals to make the most of their lives, be virtuous, and not take time for granted.

Prominent Stoic philosophers include Epictetus, Seneca, and the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose ""Meditations"" is a classic work of Stoic philosophy. While Stoicism was originally a Greco-Roman philosophy, its principles continue to be relevant and influential in contemporary discussions of personal development, resilience, and ethical living. Stoicism offers a practical and rational approach to life that encourages individuals to focus on their own character and ethical development, regardless of external circumstances.

"Stoicism is a philosophical school that originated in ancient Greece and was founded by the philosopher Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BCE 1. It is a philosophy of personal ethics that emphasizes the importance of reason, self-control, and the acceptance of fate 2. The Stoics believed that the key to a happy life was to live in accordance with nature and to accept whatever happens with equanimity 1.

The Stoics believed that the universe is governed by a divine reason, which they called the Logos 2. They believed that humans should strive to live in harmony with this divine reason and that doing so would lead to a life of tranquility and inner peace 2. The Stoics also believed in the importance of virtue, which they defined as living in accordance with reason and nature 1.

Some of the key ideas of Stoicism include:

Apatheia: This refers to a state of mind characterized by freedom from passion or emotion. The Stoics believed that apatheia was necessary for achieving inner peace and tranquility 1.
Ataraxia: This refers to a state of mind characterized by freedom from disturbance or anxiety. The Stoics believed that ataraxia was necessary for achieving happiness and well-being 1.
Eudaimonia: This refers to a state of happiness or well-being that comes from living in accordance with nature and reason 1.
Stoic Ethics: This refers to the ethical system developed by the Stoics, which emphasizes the importance of virtue, self-control, and rationality 2.
The philosophy of Stoicism has had a profound impact on Western thought and has influenced many other philosophical and religious traditions throughout history.",0

Stoicism is a philosophy of life that emphasizes the importance of virtue, self-control, and resilience. It teaches that we should not let our emotions or our circumstances control us, but should instead focus on what we can control and live in accordance with our values.

Stoicism was founded by the Greek philosopher Zeno of Citium in the 3rd century BC, and it was developed by later Stoic philosophers such as Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Stoicism was popular among the Romans, and it had a significant influence on Western thought.

The key ideas of Stoicism include:

Virtue: Stoics believe that the only good is virtue, and that everything else is indifferent. This means that we should not be attached to external things such as wealth, fame, or power, but should focus on developing our own virtuous character.
Self-control: Stoics believe that we should have control over our emotions and our desires. This means that we should not be swayed by anger, fear, or greed, but should instead maintain a calm and rational state of mind.
Resilience: Stoics believe that we should be able to withstand adversity and hardship. We should not let setbacks or disappointments defeat us, but should instead learn from them and become stronger as a result.
Stoicism is a philosophy that can help us to live happier and more fulfilling lives. It teaches us to focus on what we can control, to let go of what we cannot control, and to accept the things that we cannot change.

Here are some examples of how Stoicism can be applied in everyday life:

If you are stuck in traffic, you can choose to remain calm and patient, rather than getting angry and frustrated.
If you lose your job, you can choose to focus on your strengths and skills, and to look for new opportunities, rather than wallowing in self-pity.
If you are diagnosed with a serious illness, you can choose to face it with courage and dignity, rather than giving up hope.
Stoicism is not a philosophy of apathy or indifference. It is a philosophy of living a good life, even in the face of adversity. It is a philosophy that can teach us to be more resilient, more virtuous, and more at peace with ourselves and the world around us.",0
"Social contract theory says that people live together in society in accordance with an agreement that establishes moral and political rules of behavior. Some people believe that if we live according to a social contract, we can live morally by our own choice and not because a divine being requires it.",0
"The concept of the social contract is a foundational idea in political philosophy that addresses the origin and legitimacy of political authority, the rights and duties of citizens, and the relationship between individuals and the state. Several influential philosophers have contributed to the development of this concept, including Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Immanuel Kant. The social contract theory essentially posits that individuals come together to form a society and government through a mutual agreement or contract, which is the basis for a just and orderly society.

Here are the key elements and variations of the social contract in political philosophy:

State of Nature: The social contract theory often begins with a hypothetical ""state of nature,"" a condition in which humans exist without government or organized society. The state of nature is typically described as a condition of relative freedom and equality, but it may also involve potential conflicts and insecurity.

Social Contract: In the state of nature, individuals are imagined to agree to a social contract, a collective agreement to create a government or political authority. This contract can be explicit or implicit, but its essence is the same: individuals consent to give up certain freedoms and submit to the authority of a government in exchange for the protection of their rights and the benefits of civil society.

Legitimacy of Government: The social contract theory provides a basis for the legitimacy of government. According to this theory, government is only legitimate if it arises from the consent of the governed. It derives its authority from the people who have voluntarily come together to form a society.

Rights and Duties: The social contract defines the rights and duties of both citizens and the government. Citizens have certain rights, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, which the government is obligated to protect. In turn, citizens have a duty to obey the laws and authority of the government established through the social contract.

Forms of Government: Different versions of the social contract theory lead to different forms of government. For example, Thomas Hobbes' social contract theory, presented in ""Leviathan,"" emphasizes the need for a strong central authority to maintain order in a potentially chaotic state of nature. John Locke's theory, articulated in ""Two Treatises of Government,"" is more permissive of limited government and individual rights. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theory, presented in ""The Social Contract,"" advocates for direct democracy and the common will of the people.

Revolution and Dissent: The social contract theory allows for the possibility of revolution and resistance against an oppressive government. If the government fails to uphold its end of the social contract by violating citizens' rights, individuals may have the right to revolt or dissent in pursuit of a just and legitimate government.

The social contract concept has played a significant role in the development of modern political theory and the establishment of democratic governments. It serves as a theoretical framework for addressing questions of political authority, the balance between individual freedoms and societal order, and the rights and responsibilities of citizens and governments. Different political philosophers have offered various interpretations of the social contract, leading to diverse views on the role and nature of government in a just and orderly society.",0
"The social contract is a concept in political philosophy that refers to an agreement between the people and their government, in which the people agree to give up some of their individual rights in exchange for protection and security provided by the government 1. The social contract theory is based on the idea that individuals in a society agree to give up some of their freedom and submit to the authority of the government in order to ensure that their basic needs are met and that they are protected from harm 1.

The social contract theory has been influential in Western political thought since the Enlightenment period. Some of the most famous social contract theorists include Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau 1. These philosophers believed that the social contract was necessary to establish a just and stable society.

According to Hobbes, the social contract was necessary to prevent a state of nature, which he believed would be Ã¢â‚¬Å“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and shortÃ¢â‚¬Â 1. Locke believed that the social contract was necessary to protect individual rights and freedoms 1. Rousseau believed that the social contract was necessary to create a society that was based on the general will of the people 1.

The concept of the social contract has been used to justify many different forms of government throughout history. It has also been used as a basis for political revolutions and movements for social change.",0

The social contract is a theory in political philosophy that holds that individuals have consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of a government, in exchange for protection of their remaining rights or maintenance of the social order.

The theory of the social contract was developed by a number of philosophers, including Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Each of these philosophers had their own specific ideas about the nature of the social contract, but they all shared the basic idea that it is a voluntary agreement between individuals to create a society and government.

Hobbes argued that people agree to give up their natural freedoms and submit to the authority of a sovereign in order to escape the state of nature, which he described as a ""war of all against all."" Locke argued that people agree to give up some of their natural rights to government in exchange for the protection of their life, liberty, and property. Rousseau argued that people agree to give up their individual wills to the general will of the community in order to create a society that is based on equality and freedom.

The theory of the social contract has been used to justify the legitimacy of governments and to explain the rights and duties of citizens. It has also been used to criticize governments that are seen as oppressive or tyrannical.

Here are some examples of the social contract in practice:

When you pay taxes, you are consenting to the government's authority to spend your money on public services.
When you obey the law, you are consenting to the government's authority to regulate your behavior.
When you vote in an election, you are consenting to the government that is elected.
The theory of the social contract is a complex and contested one, but it remains an important concept in political philosophy today. It can help us to understand the nature of government, the rights and duties of citizens, and the relationship between the individual and the community.",0

"Buddhism is a major world religion that originated in ancient India and was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha (the Enlightened One). Buddhism encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, but it is characterized by several key principles and teachings. These principles are often referred to as the ""Four Noble Truths"" and the ""Eightfold Path,"" which form the foundation of Buddhist philosophy:

The Four Noble Truths:

The Truth of Suffering (Dukkha): The first noble truth acknowledges that suffering is an inherent part of life. It encompasses physical and mental suffering, as well as the unsatisfactory nature of worldly existence.

The Truth of the Cause of Suffering (Samudaya): The second noble truth identifies the cause of suffering as ""tanha,"" which is often translated as ""craving"" or ""attachment."" It suggests that suffering arises from our attachment to desires, whether they are desires for pleasure, existence, or non-existence.

The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering (Nirodha): The third noble truth offers hope by asserting that suffering can come to an end. By letting go of attachments and desires, one can achieve liberation and experience a state of peace and happiness known as ""Nirvana.""

The Truth of the Path to the Cessation of Suffering (Magga): The fourth noble truth outlines the path to the cessation of suffering. This path is known as the ""Eightfold Path"" and serves as a guide for ethical and spiritual development.

The Eightfold Path:

The Eightfold Path is a practical guide for living a moral and meaningful life and for progressing on the path to enlightenment. It is divided into three categories: wisdom (Panna), ethical conduct (Sila), and mental development (Samadhi). The eight components of the path are:

Right View: This involves understanding the nature of suffering, its causes, and the path to its cessation. It is about adopting a perspective that aligns with the Four Noble Truths.

Right Intention: It concerns the development of good intentions and attitudes, such as renouncing harmful actions and cultivating compassion and wisdom.

Right Speech: This involves refraining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter. Right speech encourages honesty, kindness, and constructive communication.

Right Action: Right action pertains to ethical conduct, such as refraining from killing, stealing, and engaging in sexual misconduct.

Right Livelihood: It relates to one's choice of occupation and emphasizes the importance of avoiding professions that cause harm, such as selling weapons or engaging in exploitative practices.

Right Effort: Right effort involves making a conscientious effort to develop positive qualities, eliminate negative ones, and maintain one's progress on the path.

Right Mindfulness: Mindfulness is the practice of being fully present and aware of one's thoughts, feelings, and actions. It is essential for self-awareness and personal growth.

Right Concentration: This involves the development of mental focus and meditation to achieve deep states of concentration and insight, ultimately leading to wisdom and enlightenment.

In addition to the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, Buddhism emphasizes other key principles, such as the importance of compassion, non-violence, and the impermanence of all things. Different branches and schools of Buddhism may have varying interpretations and practices, but these fundamental principles are shared across the tradition. Buddhism ultimately aims at attaining Nirvana, a state of liberation from suffering and the cycle of birth and death (samsara).

"Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.",0
"Nihilism is a philosophical perspective or belief that life lacks inherent meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Nihilists often assert that traditional moral and ethical values are arbitrary and that there is no objective foundation for meaning or morality. While nihilism encompasses a range of interpretations and ideas, it is often associated with the following key principles and themes:

Existential Nihilism: This form of nihilism argues that life and existence are devoid of inherent meaning or purpose. Existential nihilists contend that individuals must confront the inherent absurdity and meaninglessness of existence, and they are free to create their own values and purposes.

Moral Nihilism: Moral nihilism posits that moral values, such as right and wrong, good and evil, are subjective and lack any objective or universal basis. According to moral nihilists, moral codes and beliefs are human inventions or cultural constructs rather than inherent truths.

Epistemological Nihilism: This perspective asserts that knowledge and truth are elusive or unattainable. Epistemological nihilists question the possibility of gaining true or certain knowledge about the world due to the limitations of human cognition and perception.

Metaphysical Nihilism: Metaphysical nihilism argues that reality itself lacks fundamental structure or substance. It denies the existence of objective reality, substance, or metaphysical foundations. Some forms of metaphysical nihilism challenge the existence of entities like the self or the external world.

Political Nihilism: This perspective contends that political and social structures, as well as established norms and values, are arbitrary or oppressive. Political nihilists may advocate for the overthrow of traditional systems and institutions, often through radical or revolutionary means.

Aesthetic Nihilism: Aesthetic nihilism suggests that art, beauty, and cultural values are subjective and lack any inherent or objective aesthetic worth. It challenges traditional notions of beauty and artistic value.

It is important to note that nihilism does not prescribe a specific set of beliefs or values. Instead, it is often a critical and skeptical perspective that challenges commonly held beliefs about meaning, morality, knowledge, and reality. Some individuals may adopt nihilistic views as a form of critique or rebellion against established norms and values.

Nihilism has been explored by several philosophers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, who criticized nihilism while acknowledging its prevalence, and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, who used the term to describe the belief in the absence of meaning and purpose. Nihilism has also been a subject of literary and artistic exploration, and it has influenced various intellectual and cultural movements.

It's essential to recognize that nihilism is a complex and multifaceted concept, and interpretations and applications of nihilistic ideas can vary widely. While some individuals may embrace nihilism as a philosophical perspective, it is often viewed as a challenging and controversial stance within the realm of philosophy and ethics.

Nihilism is a philosophy that rejects the existence of objective meaning and purpose in life. Nihilists believe that there is no inherent meaning or value to anything, and that each individual must create their own meaning and purpose in life.

Nihilism can be divided into two main categories: existential nihilism and metaphysical nihilism.

Existential nihilism holds that there is no objective meaning or purpose to life, but that individuals can create their own meaning and purpose. Existential nihilists believe that we are free to choose our own path in life, and that we are responsible for our own choices.

Metaphysical nihilism holds that there is no objective reality, or that reality is unknowable. Metaphysical nihilists believe that the world as we perceive it is an illusion, and that there is no objective truth or knowledge.

Nihilism is often associated with pessimism and despair, but it can also be a liberating philosophy. If there is no objective meaning or purpose to life, then we are free to create our own meaning and purpose. We are also free to live our lives without fear of judgment or retribution.

Here are some examples of nihilism in practice:

An existential nihilist might choose to live their life in pursuit of pleasure or personal fulfillment.
A metaphysical nihilist might choose to reject all forms of authority or tradition.
A nihilist might also choose to engage in activism or social change, in order to create a better world for themselves and others.
Nihilism is a complex and challenging philosophy, but it is also a deeply rewarding one. It can help us to understand the nature of reality, our place in the world, and the freedom that we have to create our own lives.",0
"If the driver keeps the trolley on its tracks, five people will be run over and die. If, by contrast, the driver diverts the trolley, only one person will die. It seems ethically acceptable to kill one person in order to save five.",0
"The trolley problem is a well-known thought experiment in ethics and moral philosophy that presents a moral dilemma. It asks individuals to make a difficult choice between two morally conflicting options, both of which have potentially harmful consequences. The central ethical dilemma of the trolley problem can be described as follows:

Scenario: Imagine there is a runaway trolley heading down a railway track. The trolley is on course to collide with five people who are tied up and unable to move. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a different track. However, on this alternate track, there is one person who is also unable to move and would be hit by the trolley if you pull the lever.

The ethical dilemma revolves around the choice between two options:

Do Nothing: You can choose not to intervene, allowing the trolley to continue on its current path, which would result in the death of five people.

Pull the Lever: Alternatively, you can choose to pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the other track. This action would save the five people but result in the death of the one person on the alternate track.

The trolley problem raises several complex ethical questions and dilemmas:

Utilitarianism vs. Deontological Ethics: On one hand, a utilitarian perspective might suggest that pulling the lever is the morally right choice, as it would result in the greater good (saving five lives). On the other hand, deontological ethics, which emphasizes the moral duty to avoid intentionally harming others, might argue that pulling the lever is morally wrong because it involves actively causing harm to one person.

Moral Responsibility: Does one have a moral responsibility to act or intervene, even if it means actively causing harm to save more lives? Or is there a moral distinction between causing harm through action and merely allowing harm to happen through inaction?

Consequences vs. Intentions: The dilemma highlights the contrast between focusing on the consequences of an action (saving more lives) and the intentions behind an action (actively causing harm to one person).

Moral Relativism: The trolley problem can also be used to explore cultural and individual differences in ethical reasoning. People from different backgrounds and belief systems may approach the problem differently.

Role of Emotion and Empathy: The emotional response and empathy for the individuals involved can play a significant role in one's decision-making, potentially influencing the ethical choice made.

The trolley problem serves as a thought experiment to provoke discussions about ethical principles, moral decision-making, and the conflicts that can arise when facing real-life dilemmas. It has been the subject of extensive philosophical and ethical debate and has been used to explore various aspects of ethics and human nature. While it remains a theoretical scenario, its real-world relevance lies in its ability to stimulate discussions about the complexities of moral choices in difficult situations.

The trolley problem is a classic ethical dilemma that explores the morality of sacrificing one person to save many others. The problem involves a runaway trolley that is headed toward five people who are tied up on the tracks. You are standing next to a lever that can switch the trolley to a different track where only one person is standing. The dilemma is whether or not to pull the lever and sacrifice one person to save five others 1. The trolley problem has been used as a teaching tool in philosophy and ethics courses and has been the subject of much debate and discussion 1.,0

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track.

The trolley problem is a classic example of an ethical dilemma, as it forces us to choose between two equally undesirable options: sacrificing one person to save five, or doing nothing and allowing five people to die. There is no easy answer to the trolley problem, and it is a dilemma that has been debated by philosophers and ethicists for centuries.

Here are some of the different ways that people have approached the trolley problem:

Utilitarianism: Utilitarians believe that the right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In the trolley problem, this would mean diverting the trolley to kill one person in order to save five.
Deontology: Deontologists believe that there are certain moral rules that should always be followed, regardless of the consequences. In the trolley problem, this might mean that it is always wrong to kill, even if it means that more people will die.
Virtue ethics: Virtue ethicists focus on the character of the moral agent, rather than on the consequences of their actions. In the trolley problem, a virtue ethicist might ask whether it is courageous to divert the trolley, or whether it is compassionate to do nothing and allow the trolley to kill five people.
There is no one right or wrong answer to the trolley problem. It is a complex ethical dilemma that can be approached in many different ways. The important thing is to think carefully about the different options and to choose the one that you believe is the most ethical.

The trolley problem has also been used to explore a number of other ethical issues, such as:

The role of technology: The trolley problem can be seen as a metaphor for the ethical challenges posed by new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles.
The nature of responsibility: The trolley problem raises questions about who is responsible for the consequences of our actions.
The limits of our moral intuition: The trolley problem shows us that our moral intuitions are not always reliable, and that we sometimes need to think carefully about the ethical implications of our actions.
The trolley problem is a powerful and versatile thought experiment that can help us to think more deeply about ethical dilemmas. It is a reminder that there are often difficult choices to be made, and that there is no easy answer to many of the important questions in life.",0
"Kant believed that the shared ability of humans to reason should be the basis of morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, believed that all humans should have the right to common dignity and respect.",0
"Kantian ethics, often referred to as deontological ethics, is a moral philosophy developed by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century. It is based on the idea that morality is grounded in rationality and the notion of duty. Kant's ethical system is characterized by several key principles and concepts:

Categorical Imperative: The cornerstone of Kantian ethics is the ""categorical imperative."" This is a universal moral principle that applies unconditionally to all rational beings, without exceptions. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in different ways, but one of the most famous expressions is: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.""

In simpler terms, this means that when determining whether an action is morally permissible, you should consider whether you would be willing for everyone to act the same way in a similar situation. If an action can be consistently willed as a universal law without generating contradictions or absurdities, it is morally permissible.
Duty and Good Will: Kant believed that an action's moral worth is not determined by its consequences but by the motivation behind it. An action is morally praiseworthy when it is performed out of a sense of duty and guided by a ""good will,"" which is the intention to do what is morally right for its own sake.

Autonomy and Rationality: Kantian ethics emphasizes the importance of human autonomy and rationality. Autonomous individuals are those who act in accordance with their own rational principles and freely choose to follow moral laws.

Respect for Persons: Kantian ethics places a strong emphasis on the inherent worth and dignity of each individual. It argues that people should never be treated as mere means to an end but always as ends in themselves. This implies that individuals have intrinsic value and must be respected and treated with dignity.

Maxims and Universality: Kantian ethics requires individuals to formulate moral rules or ""maxims"" that can be consistently applied as universal laws. Maxims are personal principles or intentions that guide one's actions. To determine the morality of an action, one must examine the maxim behind it and see if it can be willed as a universal law without contradiction.

Moral Duties: Kant identified several moral duties that flow from the categorical imperative, including the duty not to lie, the duty not to steal, the duty not to kill, and the duty to keep promises. These duties are seen as binding on all rational beings.

Perfect and Imperfect Duties: Kant distinguishes between perfect duties, which are duties that must always be fulfilled (e.g., the duty not to lie), and imperfect duties, which are duties that should be fulfilled but allow for discretion in their application (e.g., the duty to help others in need).

Kantian ethics is a deontological system, which means it places primary emphasis on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, rather than the consequences they produce. It stands in contrast to consequentialist ethical theories like utilitarianism, which assess the morality of actions based on their outcomes.

Kant's moral philosophy has had a profound impact on ethics and remains influential in contemporary discussions of moral theory and principles. It emphasizes the significance of moral duty, rationality, and respect for the moral worth of individuals as fundamental aspects of ethical decision-making.

"Kantian ethics is a deontological ethical theory developed by German philosopher Immanuel Kant that is based on the notion that a good will is the only thing that is good without limitation 1. According to Kant, an action is morally right if it is motivated by a sense of duty and if its maxim can be willed as a universal law 1. The theory emphasizes the importance of reason, autonomy, and respect for persons 2.

Kantian ethics is based on the idea that moral principles should be universal and objective 2. It emphasizes the importance of treating people as ends in themselves rather than as means to an end 1. The theory also stresses the importance of moral autonomy, which involves making moral decisions based on reason rather than on emotions or desires 2.

KantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ethical theory has been influential in many areas of philosophy and has been applied to a wide range of ethical issues, including bioethics, environmental ethics, and business ethics 3. Some criticisms of Kantian ethics include its inability to account for the role of emotions in moral decision-making and its tendency to prioritize duty over compassion 4.",0

Kantian ethics is a deontological ethical theory developed by German philosopher Immanuel Kant. It is based on the notion that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends on its accordance with duty, and that duty is determined by reason.

Kant believed that all humans have a moral duty to act according to the categorical imperative, which is a universal moral law that can be applied to all situations. The categorical imperative is expressed in two different ways:

Formula of Universal Law: Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.
Formula of Humanity: Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.
Kant's ethics is based on the following key principles:

Autonomy: Kant believed that all humans are autonomous moral agents, meaning that we are free to choose our own actions and that we are responsible for our own choices.
Rationality: Kant believed that reason is the source of morality, and that we should act according to what reason tells us is right.
Universality: Kant believed that the moral law is universal, meaning that it applies to all humans in all situations.
Kantian ethics has been praised for its emphasis on autonomy, rationality, and universality. However, it has also been criticized for its rigidity and its lack of consideration for the consequences of actions.

Here are some examples of Kantian ethics in practice:

A doctor should treat all patients with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, religion, or social status.
A politician should make decisions that benefit the common good, even if it means sacrificing their own personal interests.
A businessperson should treat their employees fairly and with respect, and should not exploit them for personal gain.
Kantian ethics is a complex and sophisticated philosophy that has had a profound influence on Western thought. It is a philosophy that can teach us how to live better and more moral lives.",0
"The nature vs. nurture debate is a longstanding question in psychology, concerning the extent to which human behavior is determined by genetics (nature) or by environmental factors, such as upbringing and experience (nurture).",0
"The nature vs. nurture debate is a longstanding and ongoing discussion in psychology that centers around the relative importance of genetic factors (nature) and environmental factors (nurture) in shaping human behavior, development, and personality. It questions whether our genetics or our environment plays a more significant role in determining who we are as individuals.

Here's a brief overview of the key points in the nature vs. nurture debate:

Nature (Genetics):

This perspective argues that our genetic makeup, inherited from our biological parents, plays a dominant role in determining various aspects of our psychological traits, behavior, and capabilities.
It emphasizes the role of genes in shaping physical characteristics, personality traits, and even some cognitive abilities.
Proponents of the nature side often point to twin studies and adoption studies as evidence of the hereditary basis of many characteristics.
Nurture (Environment):

The nurture perspective suggests that our environment, including family, culture, upbringing, and life experiences, exerts the primary influence on our development and behavior.
It underscores the idea that individuals are shaped by their surroundings, upbringing, and life experiences, and that even genetic predispositions can be influenced and modified by environmental factors.
The nurture side often emphasizes the importance of learning, socialization, and environmental factors in shaping who we are.
It's important to note that contemporary psychology recognizes that both nature and nurture interact and influence each other. Most psychologists believe that both genetic and environmental factors are integral to human development and behavior. This interaction is often referred to as the ""nature and nurture interaction"" or ""gene-environment interaction.""

The nature vs. nurture debate has evolved over time, with many researchers and psychologists now emphasizing the importance of understanding how these factors interact to create a more comprehensive understanding of human behavior and development. The debate is not so much about choosing one side over the other but recognizing the intricate interplay between genetics and the environment in shaping human characteristics and behavior.",0
"The nature vs. nurture debate in psychology is a long-standing argument over the extent to which our behavior and personality are shaped by our genetic makeup (nature) or by our environment and experiences (nurture) 1. The debate is concerned with the relative contribution of inherited (i.e., genetic) and acquired (i.e., learned) influences on the development of traits in humans and animals 1.

The debate has been ongoing for centuries, with some researchers arguing that nature plays a more significant role in shaping our behavior, while others believe that nurture is more influential 2. However, contemporary views recognize that both nature and nurture interact in complex ways to shape our behavior and development 2.

Behavioral genetics has enabled psychology to quantify the relative contribution of nature and nurture concerning specific psychological traits 1. For instance, twin studies have shown that identical twins raised apart tend to have more similar personalities than fraternal twins, indicating a genetic component to personality 23.

In conclusion, the nature vs. nurture debate in psychology is concerned with the extent to which our behavior and personality are shaped by our genetic makeup or by our environment and experiences. While early theories favored one factor over the other, contemporary views recognize a complex interplay between genes and environment in shaping behavior and development 1.",0
"
The nature vs. nurture debate in psychology is a long-standing debate about the relative importance of genetics (nature) and environment (nurture) in determining human behavior and development.

Nature refers to the innate biological factors that we inherit from our parents, such as our genes. Nurture refers to the environmental factors that we experience after birth, such as our upbringing, education, and social relationships.

For many years, the nature vs. nurture debate was framed as a binary choice: is it our genes or our environment that shapes who we are? However, most researchers now agree that both nature and nurture play a role in human development.

Evidence for the role of nature includes:

Twin studies: Twin studies compare identical twins (who share the same genes) and fraternal twins (who share half of their genes). If identical twins are more similar to each other than fraternal twins on a particular trait, this suggests that genetics plays a role in that trait.
Family studies: Family studies compare children who are adopted into new families with children who are raised by their biological parents. If adopted children are more similar to their biological parents than to their adoptive parents on a particular trait, this suggests that genetics plays a role in that trait.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS): GWAS are large-scale studies that look for genetic variants that are associated with different traits. GWAS have identified genetic variants associated with a wide range of traits, including intelligence, personality, and mental health conditions.
Evidence for the role of nurture includes:

Environmental studies: Environmental studies look at how different environmental factors, such as parenting style, socioeconomic status, and exposure to trauma, affect human development. Environmental studies have shown that these factors can have a significant impact on a wide range of outcomes, including physical health, cognitive development, and emotional well-being.
Epigenetic studies: Epigenetic studies look at how environmental factors can influence gene expression. Epigenetic studies have shown that environmental factors can lead to changes in gene expression that can persist across generations.
Conclusion

The nature vs. nurture debate is a complex one, and there is no easy answer. Both nature and nurture play a role in human development. The relative importance of each factor varies depending on the trait in question.

For example, intelligence is a trait that is influenced by both genetics and environment. However, research suggests that genetics plays a more significant role in intelligence than environment. On the other hand, personality is a trait that is influenced by both genetics and environment, but research suggests that environment plays a more significant role in personality than genetics.

Ultimately, the nature vs. nurture debate is a reminder that we are all unique and complex individuals who are shaped by a variety of factors, both genetic and environmental.",0
"Elisabeth KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross. A Swiss American psychiatrist and pioneer of studies on dying people, KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross wrote Ã¢â‚¬Å“On Death and Dying,Ã¢â‚¬Â the 1969 book in which she proposed the patient-focused, death-adjustment pattern, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Five Stages of Grief.Ã¢â‚¬Â Those stages are denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance",0
"Elisabeth KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross was a Swiss-American psychiatrist who is well-known for her work on the stages of grief, which she introduced in her 1969 book ""On Death and Dying."" These stages represent a framework for understanding the emotional and psychological process that individuals go through when facing the prospect of their own impending death or the death of a loved one. The five stages of grief, as proposed by KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross, are:

Denial: In the initial stage, individuals often have difficulty accepting the reality of the situation. They may deny that the illness or loss is happening, or they might believe it's a mistake. This serves as a defense mechanism to cope with the shock of the news.

Anger: As the reality of the loss sets in, people may become angry. They may direct their anger toward themselves, others, or even the situation itself. It is a natural response to feelings of helplessness and frustration.

Bargaining: In this stage, individuals may attempt to make deals or bargains with a higher power, fate, or the universe in an effort to reverse or mitigate the loss. They might promise to change their behavior or do something in exchange for a better outcome.

Depression: During this stage, individuals often experience profound sadness and despair as they confront the full extent of the loss. This stage may involve feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and a sense of overwhelming grief.

Acceptance: In the final stage, individuals come to terms with the reality of the loss. They may find a way to accept it and move forward. This doesn't necessarily mean that they are ""okay"" with the loss, but they have reached a point of understanding and emotional resolution.

It's important to note that these stages were originally proposed in the context of individuals facing terminal illness and end-of-life experiences. KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross later acknowledged that these stages can be applicable to various types of grief and loss, such as the death of a loved one, divorce, or other major life changes.

However, it's crucial to understand that not everyone experiences these stages in a linear or predictable fashion, and some people may not go through all the stages. Grief is a highly individualized process, and people may move back and forth between these stages or experience them in different ways and to varying degrees. Additionally, new models and theories of grief have been developed over time to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the grieving process.",0
"Elisabeth KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross, a psychiatrist who worked with the dying and hospice patients, proposed the five stages of grief as a pattern of adjustment to death or loss in her 1969 book Ã¢â‚¬Å“On Death and DyingÃ¢â‚¬Â 1. The stages are:

Denial: The initial stage where the individual denies the reality of the situation.
Anger: The individual becomes angry and frustrated, often lashing out at others.
Bargaining: The individual tries to make deals with a higher power or others to avoid the reality of the situation.
Depression: The individual becomes overwhelmed with sadness and may withdraw from others.
Acceptance: The final stage where the individual comes to terms with the reality of the situation and begins to move forward 1.
It is important to note that these stages are not linear and some people may not experience all of them 2. Furthermore, grief is different for everyone, even if there are occasionally some similarities 3. Everyone has to make their own way through 3.",0
"
The five stages of grief according to Elisabeth KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross are:

Denial: This is a state of shock and disbelief, where the person may refuse to accept the reality of the loss.
Anger: This is a natural reaction to the pain and injustice of the loss. The person may feel angry at the person who died, at themselves, or at the world in general.
Bargaining: This is a stage where the person tries to make deals with God or fate in an attempt to change the outcome. They may promise to do anything if only their loved one could be brought back.
Depression: This is a stage of profound sadness and despair. The person may withdraw from social activities and lose interest in things that they once enjoyed.
Acceptance: This is a stage where the person comes to terms with the loss and begins to move on with their life. They may still feel sadness, but they are able to function and enjoy life again.
It is important to note that these stages are not linear, and people may move back and forth between them at different times. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, and everyone experiences it differently.

KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross's model of the five stages of grief has been widely used in psychology and grief counseling. It has helped people to understand their grief and to know that they are not alone.

"The term motivation describes why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions. Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. For instance, motivation is what helps you lose extra weight, or pushes you to get that promotion at work.",0
"The psychology of motivation is a field of psychology that focuses on understanding why individuals initiate and sustain certain behaviors. Motivation refers to the internal and external factors that drive, direct, and sustain our behavior, influencing our choices and actions. Psychologists study motivation to gain insights into what fuels human behavior and how people can be encouraged to pursue their goals and desires. Here are some key concepts and theories related to the psychology of motivation:

Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation:

Intrinsic motivation comes from within an individual. It is the desire to engage in an activity because it is personally rewarding, enjoyable, or fulfilling. People are intrinsically motivated when they do something for the sheer joy of doing it.
Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, arises from external factors, such as rewards, punishments, or societal expectations. It involves engaging in an activity to obtain a specific outcome or reward, like money, recognition, or grades.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:

Abraham Maslow's theory proposes that human motivation is organized into a hierarchy of needs. The needs are arranged in a pyramid, with basic physiological needs (e.g., food, shelter) at the base and higher-level needs (e.g., self-esteem, self-actualization) at the top. Individuals are motivated to meet lower-level needs before progressing to higher ones.
Self-Determination Theory (SDT):

SDT suggests that people are motivated when they experience autonomy, competence, and relatedness in their activities. Autonomy involves a sense of choice and control, competence is the belief in one's abilities, and relatedness pertains to meaningful connections with others.
Expectancy-Value Theory:

This theory posits that motivation is influenced by two main factors: the expectancy of success and the perceived value or importance of the outcome. When individuals believe they are likely to succeed and value the outcome, they are more motivated to pursue a particular goal.
Goal-Setting Theory:

Goal setting is a widely studied aspect of motivation. According to this theory, specific, challenging, and achievable goals lead to increased motivation and better performance. The process of setting and striving toward goals can help individuals maintain focus and persistence.
Achievement Motivation:

Achievement motivation is the drive to excel, accomplish goals, and perform well. It can be influenced by factors like the need for achievement (nAch) and the fear of failure (nAch).
Cognitive Dissonance Theory:

This theory, proposed by Leon Festinger, explores the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance, which is the discomfort arising from inconsistencies between one's beliefs and behaviors. People are motivated to resolve this discomfort, often by changing their beliefs or actions.
Self-Efficacy:

Self-efficacy, a concept developed by Albert Bandura, refers to an individual's belief in their ability to succeed in a particular task or situation. Higher self-efficacy is associated with increased motivation and perseverance.
The psychology of motivation is a complex and multifaceted field, and researchers continue to study the various factors and theories that drive human behavior. Understanding motivation is crucial in fields such as education, business, sports, and personal development, as it can help individuals and organizations achieve their goals and reach their full potential.

"The psychology of motivation is a field of study that examines the factors that influence our behavior and the reasons why we act in certain ways 1. Motivation is the driving force behind our actions, and it is what propels us to achieve our goals 1.

There are two main types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic 1. Intrinsic motivation comes from within and is driven by personal interest or enjoyment in an activity 1. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, comes from external factors such as rewards or punishments 1.

Motivation is a complex process that involves biological, emotional, social, and cognitive factors 1. Theories of motivation include MaslowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hierarchy of needs, which suggests that human needs are arranged in a hierarchy from basic physiological needs to self-actualization needs 2. Another theory is the self-determination theory, which suggests that people are motivated by three basic needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness 3.

Motivation can be influenced by a variety of factors such as personality traits, cultural norms, and social support 1. Understanding the psychology of motivation can help us to better understand why we behave in certain ways and how we can motivate ourselves to achieve our goals.

"
The psychology of motivation is the study of how and why people behave in ways that achieve their goals. It is a complex field that encompasses a wide range of topics, including:

Needs and drives: Needs are physiological and psychological deficiencies that motivate us to take action to meet them. Drives are internal states that arise when needs are not met and that push us to take action to reduce those states.
Arousal and drive: Arousal is a state of alertness and activation. It is thought to be motivated by the drive to maintain an optimal level of arousal.
Incentives and reinforcement: Incentives are external stimuli that motivate us to take action in order to obtain them. Reinforcement is the process of increasing the likelihood of a behavior by following it with a positive consequence.
Goal setting and self-efficacy: Goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound objectives that we strive to achieve. Self-efficacy is our belief in our ability to achieve our goals.
Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: Intrinsic motivation is the drive to engage in an activity for its own sake, because it is enjoyable or satisfying. Extrinsic motivation is the drive to engage in an activity in order to obtain an external reward or avoid an external punishment.
The psychology of motivation is relevant to a wide range of areas, including education, work, sports, and personal development. Understanding how motivation works can help us to achieve our goals, live more fulfilling lives, and help others to do the same.

Here are some examples of how the psychology of motivation can be applied in the real world:

Education: Teachers can use the psychology of motivation to create engaging and motivating learning experiences for their students. For example, they can set clear and achievable goals, provide positive reinforcement, and offer incentives for good performance.
Work: Employers can use the psychology of motivation to create a workplace that is motivating for their employees. For example, they can provide opportunities for growth and development, offer fair compensation and benefits, and recognize and reward good work.
Sports: Coaches can use the psychology of motivation to help their athletes achieve their goals. For example, they can help athletes to set realistic goals, develop a positive mindset, and build self-confidence.
Personal development: People can use the psychology of motivation to achieve their personal goals, such as losing weight, getting into shape, or starting a business. For example, they can break down their goals into smaller, more manageable steps, track their progress, and reward themselves for their accomplishments.
Overall, the psychology of motivation is a complex and fascinating field that has the potential to help us live more fulfilling and successful lives.

"Five of the main theories of personality are biological theories, behavioral theories, psychodynamic theories, humanist theories, and trait theories",0
"There are several key theories of personality in psychology, each offering a unique perspective on how and why individuals differ in their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Here are some of the most influential theories of personality:

Psychodynamic Theories:

Psychoanalytic Theory (Sigmund Freud): Freud's theory posits that personality is divided into three parts: the id (primitive and unconscious desires), the ego (rational and conscious part), and the superego (the moral conscience). Personality development is influenced by unconscious conflicts and early childhood experiences.

Jungian Theory (Carl Jung): Carl Jung's theory introduced the concepts of the collective unconscious and archetypes. He believed that individuals have different personality types, including introversion and extroversion, and that personality development involves individuation or self-realization.

Behavioral Theories:

Behaviorism (B.F. Skinner): Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and how they are shaped by environmental factors. Personality is seen as a set of learned responses to the environment.

Social Learning Theory (Albert Bandura): Bandura's theory builds upon behaviorism but emphasizes the role of cognitive processes, such as observational learning and self-efficacy. It suggests that individuals can learn from observing others and that self-beliefs influence behavior.

Humanistic Theories:

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (Abraham Maslow): Maslow's theory suggests that individuals are motivated to fulfill a hierarchy of needs, ranging from basic physiological needs to self-actualization, the realization of one's full potential.

Rogers' Person-Centered Theory (Carl Rogers): Rogers emphasized the importance of self-concept and self-esteem in personality development. He believed that individuals strive for self-actualization and personal growth, and that congruence between the real self and ideal self is essential for psychological well-being.

Cognitive Theories:

Cognitive-Behavioral Theory (Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck): These theories focus on the role of thoughts and beliefs in shaping personality and behavior. Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Beck's Cognitive Therapy address how irrational beliefs and cognitive distortions can lead to emotional and behavioral problems.
Trait Theories:

Five-Factor Model (Big Five): This contemporary model of personality includes five major traits: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. It provides a framework for understanding individual differences based on these five dimensions.

Eysenck's PEN Model (Hans Eysenck): Eysenck proposed that personality can be described along three major dimensions: psychoticism, extraversion, and neuroticism. His theory has been influential in the study of personality and individual differences.

Biological Theories:

**Biological theories of personality, including genetics and brain structure, explore the genetic and physiological factors that may contribute to personality traits and individual differences.
Social-Cognitive Theories:

Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory: This theory combines cognitive and social elements, emphasizing the reciprocal interaction between personal, behavioral, and environmental factors. It underscores the role of self-regulation, observational learning, and self-efficacy in personality development.
These are just a few of the many theories of personality in psychology. It's important to note that personality is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, and different theories provide different perspectives and insights into understanding it. Many contemporary psychologists incorporate elements from multiple theories to gain a more comprehensive understanding of personality.




",0
"There are several key theories of personality that have been proposed by psychologists. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

Trait theory: This theory suggests that personality is made up of a set of traits or characteristics that are relatively stable over time and across situations 1. Some of the most well-known trait theories include AllportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trait theory, CattellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 16-factor personality model, EysenckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three-dimensional model, and the five-factor model of personality 2.

Psychodynamic theory: This theory emphasizes the role of unconscious processes in shaping personality 3. Sigmund FreudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s psychoanalytic theory is one of the most well-known psychodynamic theories, which suggests that personality is shaped by unconscious conflicts between different parts of the psyche 3.

Humanistic theory: This theory emphasizes the importance of personal growth and self-actualization in shaping personality 3. Carl RogersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ person-centered theory is one of the most well-known humanistic theories, which suggests that people have an innate drive to grow and develop into their full potential 3.

Behavioral theory: This theory suggests that personality is shaped by our environment and experiences 3. B.F. SkinnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s operant conditioning theory is one of the most well-known behavioral theories, which suggests that behavior is shaped by rewards and punishments in the environment 3.

Social-cognitive theory: This theory emphasizes the role of cognitive processes in shaping personality 4. Albert BanduraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social learning theory is one of the most well-known social-cognitive theories, which suggests that people learn by observing others and modeling their behavior 4.

These are just a few examples of the many theories that have been proposed to explain personality. Each theory has its strengths and weaknesses, and researchers continue to explore new ways to understand this complex topic.",0
"
There are many different theories of personality, each with its own unique perspective. Some of the most well-known theories include:

Psychoanalytic theories: These theories focus on the unconscious mind and early childhood experiences as the primary determinants of personality. Sigmund Freud's psychosexual theory and Erik Erikson's psychosocial stages of development are two well-known psychoanalytic theories.
Humanistic theories: These theories focus on the individual's capacity for self-actualization and the importance of free will. Carl Rogers's person-centered theory and Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs are two well-known humanistic theories.
Trait theories: These theories focus on the identification and measurement of personality traits. Hans Eysenck's three-factor theory and Raymond Cattell's five-factor model (also known as the Big 5) are two well-known trait theories.
Social-cognitive theories: These theories focus on the role of learning and social interaction in the development and expression of personality. Albert Bandura's social learning theory and Julian Rotter's social learning theory are two well-known social-cognitive theories.
Biological theories: These theories focus on the role of genetics and neurobiology in personality. Temperament theory and evolutionary psychology are two well-known biological theories of personality.
No single theory of personality can fully explain the complex phenomenon of human personality. However, each of these theories offers valuable insights into different aspects of personality.

Here is a brief overview of each theory:

Psychoanalytic theories

Psychoanalytic theories view personality as a dynamic system that is constantly striving for balance between three competing forces: the id, the ego, and the superego.

The id is the primitive, impulsive part of personality that is driven by basic needs and desires.
The ego is the rational part of personality that mediates between the id and the superego.
The superego is the moralistic part of personality that internalizes society's values and standards.
Psychoanalytic theories emphasize the importance of early childhood experiences in shaping personality. They believe that unresolved conflicts from early childhood can lead to personality problems in later life.

Humanistic theories

Humanistic theories view personality as a product of free will and conscious choice. They emphasize the importance of self-actualization, which is the process of realizing one's full potential.

Humanistic theories believe that everyone has an innate tendency to grow and develop in a positive direction. However, this growth can be thwarted by unfavorable environmental conditions.

Trait theories

Trait theories view personality as a collection of stable, enduring characteristics. These traits are thought to be relatively stable across time and situations.

Trait theories have identified a number of different personality traits, such as introversion-extraversion, neuroticism-stability, agreeableness-disagreeableness, conscientiousness-irresponsibility, and openness to experience.

Social-cognitive theories

Social-cognitive theories view personality as a product of learning and social interaction. They emphasize the role of observation, modeling, and reinforcement in shaping personality.

Social-cognitive theories believe that our personalities are constantly evolving as we learn new things and interact with new people.

Biological theories

Biological theories view personality as being influenced by genetic and neurobiological factors. Temperament theory, for example, suggests that certain personality traits, such as extroversion and introversion, are largely determined by temperament.

Evolutionary psychology suggests that certain personality traits, such as aggression and risk-taking, have evolved because they have been advantageous in terms of survival and reproduction.

Conclusion

Each of these theories of personality offers valuable insights into different aspects of personality. However, no single theory can fully explain the complex phenomenon of human personality. It is likely that a combination of factors, including genetics, environment, and learning, all play a role in shaping personality.

Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort a person feels when their behavior does not align with their values or beliefs. Cognitive dissonance is not a disease or illness. It is a psychological phenomenon that can happen to anyone. American psychologist Leon Festinger first developed the concept in the 1950s.,0
"Cognitive dissonance is a psychological concept introduced by American psychologist Leon Festinger in 1957. It refers to the discomfort or tension that arises when an individual holds two or more contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or values, or when there is a conflict between one's beliefs and their behavior. This state of cognitive dissonance is often experienced as a psychological discomfort or unease.

The key components of cognitive dissonance theory include:

Cognition: This term refers to any thought, belief, attitude, or piece of information that a person holds. It can be about anything, from personal values and political beliefs to everyday decisions.

Cognitive Dissonance: When there is inconsistency or conflict between two or more cognitions, it creates cognitive dissonance. For example, if someone believes that smoking is harmful to health (Cognition A) but continues to smoke (Cognition B), this contradiction creates cognitive dissonance.

Discomfort: The presence of cognitive dissonance causes psychological discomfort and tension. This discomfort motivates individuals to reduce the inconsistency and resolve the conflict.

Resolution: People typically seek to alleviate cognitive dissonance by changing one or more of their cognitions. There are several ways to achieve this, including:

Changing one's behavior to be more in line with their beliefs (e.g., quitting smoking).
Changing their beliefs or attitudes to justify their behavior (e.g., convincing oneself that smoking is not as harmful as believed).
Adding new cognitions that support or rationalize the inconsistency (e.g., believing that the stress relief from smoking outweighs the health risks).
Cognitive dissonance theory has been widely studied and applied in various contexts, including marketing, persuasion, decision-making, and social psychology. For example, marketers use it to understand how to change consumer attitudes and behaviors by minimizing dissonance associated with their products. In interpersonal relationships, it helps explain how people justify their actions and choices to maintain a sense of consistency and self-concept.

Understanding cognitive dissonance is essential for comprehending how people cope with conflicting beliefs and the psychological mechanisms they use to reduce discomfort. It is also a valuable concept in explaining why individuals may resist changing their opinions or behaviors, even when presented with persuasive evidence to the contrary.

"Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when a person holds two or more contradictory beliefs, values, or ideas, or engages in behavior that conflicts with their beliefs 1. This inconsistency can cause feelings of discomfort, tension, and anxiety, which can motivate the person to reduce the dissonance by changing their beliefs or behavior 2.

According to the theory of cognitive dissonance, people have a natural tendency to seek consistency between their beliefs and actions 2. When there is a discrepancy between the two, it creates a state of cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by changing oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beliefs or actions 2. For example, if someone believes that smoking is harmful to their health but continues to smoke, they may experience cognitive dissonance. To reduce the discomfort caused by this inconsistency, they may either quit smoking or rationalize their behavior by minimizing the risks associated with smoking 1.

Cognitive dissonance has been studied extensively in social psychology and has been applied to various domains such as consumer behavior, decision-making, and attitude change 1. Understanding cognitive dissonance can help us better understand why people behave in certain ways and how we can change our own behavior.",0
"
Cognitive dissonance is a psychological state of discomfort that arises when a person holds two contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors at the same time. It is the result of the tension between the two opposing forces.

Cognitive dissonance can be caused by a number of factors, such as:

New information that contradicts existing beliefs: For example, a person who believes that smoking is safe may experience cognitive dissonance if they learn that smoking causes cancer.
A change in behavior that is inconsistent with existing beliefs: For example, a person who believes that it is important to be environmentally friendly may experience cognitive dissonance if they buy a new car that gets poor gas mileage.
External pressure to change one's beliefs or behavior: For example, a person who believes that it is wrong to lie may experience cognitive dissonance if they are pressured by their friends to lie about something.
When people experience cognitive dissonance, they are motivated to reduce the discomfort. This can be done in a number of ways, including:

Changing one of the contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors: For example, a person who believes that smoking is safe may change their belief after learning about the dangers of smoking.
Adding new information to support the existing belief: For example, a person who believes that smoking is safe may start reading articles that support this belief.
Downplaying the importance of the contradictory belief: For example, a person who believes that it is important to be environmentally friendly may downplay the importance of gas mileage when buying a new car.
Justifying the contradictory behavior: For example, a person who believes that it is wrong to lie may justify lying to their friends by saying that they were only trying to protect their friends from getting hurt.
Cognitive dissonance is a normal and common experience. It is a way that our minds try to maintain consistency in our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. However, if cognitive dissonance is not resolved, it can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression.

Here are some examples of cognitive dissonance:

A smoker who knows that smoking causes cancer but continues to smoke.
A person who believes in equal rights for all people but discriminates against others based on their race, religion, or sexual orientation.
A politician who promises to reduce government spending but then increases taxes.
A person who believes that it is important to be honest but then lies to get ahead.
Cognitive dissonance can be a powerful force in our lives. It can motivate us to change our beliefs and behaviors, or it can lead to rationalization and justification. By understanding cognitive dissonance, we can better understand our own thoughts and behaviors, and we can make more informed decisions.

"When stress becomes overwhelming and prolonged, the risks for mental health problems and medical problems increase. Long-term stress increases the risk of mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, substance use problems, sleep problems, pain and bodily complaints such as muscle tension.",0
"Stress can have a significant impact on mental health, and prolonged or chronic stress can lead to a range of emotional and psychological problems. The effects of stress on mental health can vary from person to person, but some common consequences include:

Anxiety: Stress can trigger or exacerbate anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder. People under stress may experience excessive worry, restlessness, and a heightened state of alertness.

Depression: Chronic stress is a known risk factor for the development of depression. Stress can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable. It can also worsen the symptoms of existing depressive disorders.

Insomnia and Sleep Disorders: Stress often disrupts sleep patterns, leading to difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing restful sleep. Sleep disturbances, in turn, can negatively impact mood and cognitive functioning.

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Exposure to extreme stress or traumatic events can result in the development of PTSD. This condition is characterized by intrusive memories, nightmares, heightened arousal, and avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event.

Substance Abuse: Some individuals turn to alcohol, drugs, or other substances as a way to cope with stress. This can lead to substance abuse or addiction, which can further exacerbate mental health issues.

Cognitive Impairment: Stress can impair cognitive functions such as concentration, memory, and decision-making. This can affect a person's ability to perform daily tasks and work effectively.

Irritability and Anger: Stress can make individuals more prone to irritability and anger outbursts. They may become less patient and have a shorter temper, which can strain relationships.

Eating Disorders: Some people respond to stress by overeating or undereating, which can lead to the development of eating disorders such as binge eating disorder, anorexia, or bulimia.

Physical Health Consequences: The physical effects of chronic stress, such as increased blood pressure and a weakened immune system, can indirectly affect mental health. Poor physical health can contribute to a negative emotional state.

Social Isolation: People under prolonged stress may withdraw from social activities and relationships, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can further impact mental well-being.

Suicidal Thoughts: In severe cases, chronic stress can lead to thoughts of self-harm or suicide. People who experience suicidal ideation should seek immediate help and support.

It's important to note that individuals vary in their responses to stress, and not everyone exposed to the same stressors will develop mental health issues. Additionally, the relationship between stress and mental health is complex, with various factors, including genetics, coping strategies, and social support, influencing an individual's vulnerability to stress-related mental health problems.

Managing and reducing stress through healthy coping mechanisms, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and seeking social support, can be essential in protecting and promoting mental health. When stress starts to negatively impact mental well-being, it is advisable to seek help from mental health professionals who can provide support and appropriate interventions.

"Stress is a natural response to challenging situations, but when it becomes chronic, it can have negative effects on our mental health 1. Chronic stress can increase the risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, substance use, and sleep problems 1. It can also lead to emotional overwhelm and burnout, especially in long-term stressful situations like caregiving 1.

Stress can have negative effects on both the body and mind and create symptoms such as headache, muscle tension, chest pain, lack of motivation, restlessness, and angry outbursts 1. It can also cause cognitive, emotional, or behavioral changes 2. For example, stress can lead to memory issues or changes in certain areas of the brain that regulate emotions 2.

The biology of stress is complex and involves the release of chemicals such as serotonin and adrenaline within seconds of perceiving a stressor 2. Over time, this stress response can wear you down mentally and physically 2.

It is important to recognize the signs of stress and take steps to manage it. Some ways to manage stress include exercise, relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation, social support from friends or family members, and seeking professional help if needed 1.",0

Stress can have a significant impact on mental health. When we experience stress, our bodies release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones prepare our bodies for the fight-or-flight response, which is a natural physiological response to danger.

However, if stress is chronic or prolonged, the fight-or-flight response can remain active, even when there is no real danger present. This can lead to a number of negative mental health consequences, including:

Anxiety: Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease. It can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as a racing heart, sweating, and muscle tension.
Depression: Depression is a feeling of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness. It can lead to a loss of interest in activities that were once enjoyable, changes in appetite and sleep, and difficulty concentrating.
Irritability and mood swings: Stress can make people more irritable and prone to mood swings.
Difficulty concentrating and making decisions: Stress can make it difficult to focus on tasks and make decisions.
Sleep problems: Stress can lead to insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and waking up frequently during the night.
Increased risk of substance abuse: Stress can increase the risk of developing substance abuse problems, as people may turn to drugs or alcohol to cope with stress.
In addition to these mental health consequences, stress can also lead to physical health problems such as headaches, stomachaches, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

It is important to find healthy ways to manage stress to protect your mental and physical health. Some helpful stress management techniques include:

Exercise: Exercise is a great way to reduce stress and improve your overall mood.
Relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and meditation can help to reduce stress and promote relaxation.
Social support: Spending time with loved ones and talking about your problems can help to reduce stress and improve your coping mechanisms.
Time management: Learning to manage your time effectively can help to reduce stress and prevent burnout.
If you are struggling to cope with stress, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. They can help you to develop a stress management plan that is right for you.",0
"When making a decision, we form opinions and choose actions via mental processes which are influenced by biases, reason, emotions, and memories. The simple act of deciding supports the notion that we have free will. We weigh the benefits and costs of our choice, and then we cope with the consequences.",0
"The psychology of decision-making is a complex field that explores how individuals make choices and the various factors that influence these choices. Decision-making is a fundamental cognitive process, and psychologists have developed numerous theories and models to understand the underlying mechanisms. Here are some key aspects of the psychology behind decision-making:

Rational Decision-Making Model:

The rational decision-making model suggests that individuals make choices by systematically evaluating all available options, considering the pros and cons, and selecting the option that maximizes their expected utility or satisfaction. However, people often deviate from this idealized model due to cognitive limitations and emotional influences.
Dual-Process Theories:

Dual-process theories propose that decision-making involves two distinct cognitive processes:
System 1 (Automatic Thinking): This process involves quick, intuitive, and often emotional decision-making. It relies on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, and is prone to biases and errors.
System 2 (Analytical Thinking): This process is slower, deliberate, and analytical. It involves careful consideration of facts and is less influenced by emotions and biases.
Cognitive Biases:

Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking that can affect decision-making. Common biases include confirmation bias (seeking information that confirms existing beliefs), anchoring bias (relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered), and availability bias (favoring readily available information).
Prospect Theory:

Developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, prospect theory suggests that people evaluate potential outcomes in terms of potential gains and losses rather than final states. Loss aversion, where losses have a greater impact on decisions than equivalent gains, is a central concept in this theory.
Emotion and Decision-Making:

Emotions play a significant role in decision-making. They can influence our preferences and choices, sometimes leading to impulsive decisions. Emotional decision-making is often associated with the brain's limbic system, particularly the amygdala.
Risk and Uncertainty:

Decision-making often involves assessing and managing risks. Prospect theory, as mentioned earlier, deals with how people evaluate potential risks and rewards. The way individuals perceive and handle uncertainty can vary based on their tolerance for risk.
Social and Cultural Factors:

Social and cultural factors influence decision-making. Norms, values, and social influences can impact the choices individuals make. Cultural differences in decision-making processes have been extensively studied in cross-cultural psychology.
Heuristics and Biases:

People frequently use heuristics, which are mental shortcuts, to simplify complex decision-making tasks. However, these shortcuts can lead to cognitive biases that result in suboptimal decisions.
Neuroscience of Decision-Making:

Neuroimaging studies have shed light on the neural processes behind decision-making. The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functions, plays a crucial role in evaluating options, making choices, and inhibiting impulsive behavior.
Decision-Making Under Stress:

Stress can impact decision-making by narrowing cognitive focus, increasing emotional reactivity, and reducing the ability to weigh pros and cons rationally. This can lead to impulsive or suboptimal choices in high-pressure situations.
Understanding the psychology of decision-making is essential in various fields, including economics, marketing, and behavioral economics. It provides insights into why people make certain choices and helps researchers and practitioners design interventions to improve decision quality.

"The psychology behind decision-making is a field of study that examines the cognitive processes that underlie peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s judgments and choices from several possibilities 1. It explores how individuals and groups make decisions in various domains, such as consumer, social, clinical, managerial, and organizational decision making 1.

Decision-making is a complex process that involves weighing the pros and cons of different options and choosing the best course of action 2. It is influenced by a variety of factors such as biases, reason, emotions, and memories 3.

There are several strategies for making good decisions. One such strategy is to gather as much information as possible and consider all possible alternatives along with their attendant benefits and costs 2. Another strategy is to use critical thinking skills to avoid common errors or bias 2.

The psychology of decision-making has been applied to various domains such as consumer behavior, decision-making, and attitude change 1. Understanding the psychology of decision-making can help us better understand why people behave in certain ways and how we can change our own behavior.",0
"The psychology behind decision-making is a complex and fascinating field of study. Researchers have identified a number of cognitive biases and mental shortcuts that can influence our decision-making process.

Here are some of the key factors that influence decision-making:

Rationality: Rational decision-making involves carefully considering all of the available options and choosing the option that is most likely to lead to the desired outcome. However, people often make decisions that are not fully rational. This can be due to a number of factors, such as limited time and resources, cognitive biases, and emotions.
Heuristics: Heuristics are mental shortcuts that we use to make decisions quickly and efficiently. Heuristics can be useful in many situations, but they can also lead to errors in judgment. For example, the availability heuristic is a heuristic that leads us to make decisions based on the information that is most readily available to us, even if that information is not representative of the overall situation.
Cognitive biases: Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking that can influence our decision-making. For example, the confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that leads us to seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs and to ignore information that contradicts our beliefs.
Emotions: Emotions can also play a significant role in decision-making. For example, people are more likely to take risks when they are feeling happy or excited, and they are more likely to make conservative decisions when they are feeling anxious or scared.
In addition to these factors, decision-making can also be influenced by a number of other factors, such as social and cultural norms, personal values, and past experiences.

Here are some examples of how the psychology of decision-making can play out in real life:

A person who is short on time may make a quick decision about what to buy at the grocery store without carefully considering all of the options. This is an example of how heuristics can influence decision-making.
A person who has been burned by a bad investment in the past may be hesitant to invest in anything new. This is an example of how cognitive biases can influence decision-making.
A person who is feeling happy and excited may be more likely to take a risk, such as starting their own business. This is an example of how emotions can influence decision-making.
Understanding the psychology of decision-making can help us to make better decisions in our own lives. It can also help us to understand how others make decisions, which can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as business, politics, and personal relationships.",0
"Memory refers to the psychological processes of acquiring, storing, retaining, and later retrieving information. There are three major processes involved in memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval. Human memory involves the ability to both preserve and recover information.",0
"Human memory is a complex and multifaceted cognitive system that involves the ability to encode, store, and retrieve information from past experiences. It is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, shaping our understanding of the world, our ability to learn, and our capacity to adapt and make decisions. The nature of human memory can be understood through several key components and processes:

Encoding: This is the first stage of memory where information from the external world is converted into a form that can be stored in memory. Encoding involves sensory input, which can be visual, auditory, tactile, or other sensory modalities. It's influenced by attention, perception, and the depth of processing (e.g., shallow vs. deep processing).

Storage: Once information is encoded, it is stored in various memory systems. Human memory is often conceptualized as having different storage systems, including:

Sensory Memory: Very brief storage of sensory input, such as iconic (visual) and echoic (auditory) memory.
Short-Term Memory (STM): Limited-capacity memory that temporarily holds information for immediate use, often referred to as working memory.
Long-Term Memory (LTM): A vast and relatively permanent storage system that can hold information for extended periods.
Retrieval: This is the process of accessing stored information when needed. Retrieval involves bringing stored memories into conscious awareness, and it can be influenced by various factors, such as context, cues, and interference from other memories.

Types of Memory:

Episodic Memory: This involves the recollection of specific events or experiences, including their context and the emotions associated with them.
Semantic Memory: This is the storage of general knowledge, facts, and concepts that are not tied to specific personal experiences.
Procedural Memory: This is the memory of how to perform various skills and tasks, often involving motor skills or sequences of actions.
Declarative Memory: This refers to conscious, explicit memory, which includes both episodic and semantic memory.
Non-declarative Memory: This refers to implicit memory, which is not consciously accessible and includes procedural and other forms of memory that affect behavior without conscious awareness.
Forgetting: Forgetting is a natural and normal part of memory. It can occur for various reasons, such as interference from other memories, decay over time, or the absence of retrieval cues.

Reconstruction: Memory is not like a video recording but is a reconstructive process. When we remember events, we often reconstruct them by piecing together fragments of information. This process can be influenced by our beliefs, expectations, and the influence of new information.

Amnesia: Amnesia is a condition characterized by partial or complete memory loss. It can result from brain injury, illness, or psychological trauma.

Neurobiology of Memory: The biological basis of memory involves the brain's complex network of neurons, synapses, and various brain regions, including the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a phenomenon that is believed to underlie the formation of long-term memories.

Emotional and Flashbulb Memories: Emotions can significantly impact the formation and retrieval of memories. Flashbulb memories are vivid and emotionally charged memories of highly significant events.

Memory Improvement: Strategies for improving memory include rehearsal, elaborative encoding, spacing of study sessions, mnemonic techniques, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

The nature of human memory is a fascinating and continuously evolving area of research in psychology and neuroscience. It plays a crucial role in our everyday lives, from recalling personal experiences to learning and adapting to new information. Memory is also a central topic in understanding cognitive disorders, aging, and neurological conditions.

"Human memory is a complex and multifaceted cognitive process that involves the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information 1. It is the ability to acquire, retain, and recall information and experiences 1. Memory can be divided into several types based on the duration of retention, such as sensory memory, short-term memory, working memory, and long-term memory 1.

Sensory memory is the briefest form of memory that lasts only a few seconds and allows us to retain sensory information such as sights, sounds, smells, and touch 2. Short-term memory is the next stage of memory that lasts for a few seconds to a minute and allows us to hold information in our minds for immediate use 2. Working memory is a type of short-term memory that allows us to hold information in our minds while we perform mental operations on it 2. Long-term memory is the final stage of memory that can last for days, weeks, months, or even years and allows us to store vast amounts of information about our past experiences and knowledge 2.

Memory is not a flawless process. Sometimes people forget or misremember things. Other times, information is not properly encoded in memory in the first place 3. Memory problems are often relatively minor annoyances, like forgetting birthdays 3.

The biology of memory is complex and involves many parts of the brain working together. The hippocampus is one of the most important regions involved in the formation of new memories 4. The amygdala plays a role in emotional memories such as fear or pleasure 4. The prefrontal cortex helps us to retrieve memories from long-term storage 4.

In conclusion, human memory is a complex cognitive process that involves several stages of retention. It can be divided into several types based on the duration of retention. Memory is not perfect and can be influenced by various factors such as age, stress, sleep deprivation, and disease. Understanding the nature of human memory can help us better understand how we learn and remember things.",0

Human memory is a complex cognitive process that allows us to acquire, store, and retrieve information. It is essential for our ability to learn, function in everyday life, and maintain a sense of personal identity.

There are three main stages of memory: encoding, storage, and retrieval.

Encoding is the process of converting information into a form that can be stored in the brain. This can be done through a variety of means, such as visual imagery, verbal encoding, and semantic encoding.

Storage is the process of maintaining information in the brain over time. There are two main types of memory storage: short-term memory and long-term memory.

Short-term memory (STM) is a limited-capacity system that can store information for up to about 30 seconds without rehearsal. STM is used to hold information in mind while we are working on it, such as when we are trying to remember a phone number that we have just been given.

Long-term memory (LTM) is a large-capacity system that can store information for an indefinite period of time. LTM is subdivided into two main types: explicit memory and implicit memory.

Explicit memory is the type of memory that we are consciously aware of and that we can intentionally retrieve. Examples of explicit memory include episodic memory (memories of specific events) and semantic memory (memories of facts and concepts).

Implicit memory is the type of memory that we are not consciously aware of and that we cannot intentionally retrieve. Examples of implicit memory include procedural memory (memories of how to do things) and priming (the influence of prior experiences on current behavior).

Retrieval is the process of accessing and using information that is stored in the brain. Retrieval can be either spontaneous or intentional. Spontaneous retrieval occurs when information comes to mind without any conscious effort. Intentional retrieval occurs when we consciously try to remember something.

Human memory is not perfect. We forget information for a variety of reasons, such as decay (the passage of time), interference (the competition between different memories), and repression (the unconscious blocking of memories).

However, human memory is also remarkably adaptable. We can improve our memory by using a variety of techniques, such as repetition, chunking, and mnemonic devices.

Research on human memory is ongoing, and scientists are constantly learning new things about how it works. Understanding the nature of human memory is essential for developing effective teaching and learning strategies, as well as for treating memory disorders.",0
"happiness, in psychology, a state of emotional well-being that a person experiences either in a narrow sense, when good things happen in a specific moment, or more broadly, as a positive evaluation of one's life and accomplishments overallÃ¢â‚¬â€that is, subjective well-being.",0
"The psychology of happiness is a subfield of psychology that focuses on understanding the nature of happiness, the factors that contribute to it, and how individuals can achieve and sustain a sense of well-being and life satisfaction. It explores the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of happiness. Here are some key concepts and theories in the psychology of happiness:

Subjective Well-Being (SWB): Subjective well-being is a central concept in the study of happiness. It refers to an individual's self-assessment of their overall life satisfaction and emotional well-being. SWB is often measured through self-report assessments that include questions about life satisfaction and emotional experiences.

Hedonic vs. Eudaimonic Happiness:

Hedonic Well-Being: Hedonic happiness is focused on pleasure and the avoidance of pain. It is often associated with the pursuit of positive emotions and the minimization of negative ones. This perspective is closely related to the concept of ""feeling good.""
Eudaimonic Well-Being: Eudaimonic happiness emphasizes self-fulfillment, meaning, and the realization of one's potential. It involves living in accordance with one's values and engaging in activities that provide a sense of purpose and personal growth.
Positive Psychology: Positive psychology is a branch of psychology that emphasizes the study of positive emotions, strengths, and well-being. It seeks to promote human flourishing and happiness by examining the factors that contribute to a fulfilling life.

Set-Point Theory: The set-point theory suggests that individuals have a baseline level of happiness to which they tend to return after experiencing positive or negative life events. This baseline is relatively stable over time and is influenced by genetic and personality factors.

Adaptation: The adaptation or hedonic treadmill theory posits that people adapt to life changes, whether positive or negative, and eventually return to their baseline level of happiness. This suggests that the long-term impact of life events on happiness may be less significant than initially believed.

Positive Emotions: Positive emotions play a critical role in happiness. Experiencing emotions like joy, gratitude, love, and contentment contribute to well-being. The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions suggests that these emotions can broaden an individual's mindset and build personal resources for future well-being.

Flow: Flow is a state of optimal experience where individuals are fully engaged in an activity, losing track of time and experiencing a deep sense of enjoyment. Achieving flow states is associated with increased happiness and life satisfaction.

Social Connections: Strong social relationships, including friendships and close family ties, are significant predictors of happiness. Social support, meaningful connections, and a sense of belonging are essential for well-being.

Character Strengths: Positive psychology emphasizes the development and application of character strengths such as gratitude, resilience, kindness, and self-compassion as ways to enhance happiness and life satisfaction.

Cultural and Individual Differences: The perception of happiness varies across cultures and individuals. What contributes to happiness can be influenced by cultural values, personal goals, and life circumstances.

Interventions and Positive Interventions: Researchers and psychologists have developed interventions to enhance happiness, such as gratitude exercises, mindfulness practices, and positive psychology interventions. These methods aim to improve well-being and life satisfaction.

The psychology of happiness is a dynamic and evolving field that seeks to understand the factors that contribute to a fulfilling and satisfying life. It has practical applications in promoting mental health, enhancing overall well-being, and helping individuals lead happier and more meaningful lives.

"The psychology of happiness is a field of study that examines the emotional well-being and satisfaction of people 1. It explores the factors that influence positive subjective experience, positive individual traits, and positive institutions 1. Happiness is not only a result of good things happening in a specific moment, but also a reflection of oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and accomplishments overall 1.

Happiness involves curiosity, balance, goals, and social support 1. It is generally linked to experiencing more positive feelings than negative ones 2. Two key components of happiness (or subjective well-being) are the balance of emotions and life satisfaction 2. Life satisfaction relates to how satisfied you feel with different areas of your life including your relationships, work, achievements, and other things that you consider important 2.

The psychological inquiry into happiness is important because happiness is not only associated with improved physical health and even longevity, but it is also a priority for people Ã¢â‚¬â€œ across the world, happiness has been rated as being more important than other desirable outcomes including living a meaningful life or making a lot of money 3.

There are several theories of happiness that have been proposed by psychologists. One such theory is the hedonic theory, which suggests that happiness is the outcome of the pursuit of pleasure over pain 3. Another theory is the eudaimonic theory, which suggests that happiness comes from living a virtuous life and fulfilling oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potential 3.

In conclusion, the psychology of happiness is concerned with understanding what makes people happy and how they can achieve greater well-being. Happiness involves several factors such as curiosity, balance, goals, and social support. There are several theories of happiness that have been proposed by psychologists.",0
"The psychology of happiness is the study of the psychological factors that contribute to human well-being. It is a relatively new field of study, but it has grown rapidly in recent years.

There are a number of different theories about the psychology of happiness. One popular theory is the broaden-and-build theory, which posits that positive emotions broaden our thinking and build our resources. This means that when we are happy, we are more likely to be creative, open-minded, and resilient.

Another popular theory is the self-determination theory, which posits that people are motivated to grow and develop when they have a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Autonomy is the feeling of being in control of one's own life. Competence is the feeling of being able to achieve one's goals. Relatedness is the feeling of being connected to others.

Research has shown that both of these theories are supported by evidence. For example, studies have shown that people who experience more positive emotions are more likely to be creative, have stronger relationships, and be more successful in their careers. Additionally, studies have shown that people who have a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are more likely to be happy and satisfied with their lives.

Other factors that have been linked to happiness include:

Social support: Having strong relationships with family and friends is a key factor in happiness.
Meaningful work: Having a job that is meaningful and gives you a sense of purpose can contribute to happiness.
Physical health: Taking care of your physical health by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep is important for happiness.
Gratitude: Practicing gratitude, or taking the time to appreciate the good things in your life, can boost happiness.
It is important to note that happiness is not a fixed state of being. It is something that fluctuates over time and depends on a variety of factors. However, there are things that you can do to increase your happiness levels. By focusing on the factors that contribute to happiness, you can improve your overall well-being and live a more fulfilling life.",0
"The earliest Western institution that can be called a university was a famous medical school that arose at Salerno, Italy, in the 9th century and drew students from all over Europe. It remained merely a medical school, however. The first true university in the West was founded at Bologna late in the 11th century",0
"The history of the university system is a long and complex one that has evolved over centuries. Universities have played a central role in the development of education, scholarship, and the dissemination of knowledge. Here is a brief overview of the history of the university system:

Ancient Origins: The concept of higher education can be traced back to ancient civilizations. In ancient Greece, institutions like the Academy founded by Plato and the Lyceum founded by Aristotle were centers of learning and philosophy. In ancient India, institutions like Nalanda and Takshashila were renowned centers of learning.

Medieval Universities: The modern university system as we know it began to take shape in Europe during the Middle Ages. Some of the earliest universities were established in Bologna, Italy (1088), Paris, France (1150), and Oxford, England (12th century). These universities focused on religious studies, law, and medicine and were often associated with the Catholic Church.

Renaissance and Humanism: The Renaissance period in Europe (14th to 17th centuries) saw a revival of interest in the classical texts of Greece and Rome. Humanism, an intellectual movement that emphasized the study of classical literature and the liberal arts, had a significant influence on the curriculum and character of universities.

Enlightenment and Modernization: The Enlightenment period (17th and 18th centuries) emphasized reason, critical thinking, and the scientific method. Universities began to expand their curriculum to include a wider range of subjects, including natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.

Colonial and American Universities: Universities were established in the American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries, such as Harvard (1636) and Yale (1701). These institutions were influenced by European models but adapted to the needs of the New World. American universities later played a key role in shaping the research-focused university model.

Industrial Revolution and Research Universities: The Industrial Revolution (18th and 19th centuries) led to a greater emphasis on scientific and technological education. German universities, particularly the University of Berlin, played a critical role in shaping the modern research university model. Research-focused universities became centers of innovation and intellectual advancement.

20th Century and Mass Higher Education: The 20th century witnessed a significant expansion of higher education, with many countries investing in the creation of universities and the expansion of enrollment. The G.I. Bill in the United States after World War II, for example, enabled millions of veterans to access higher education.

Diversification of Disciplines: The university system diversified its academic programs to include a wide range of disciplines and fields of study. Today's universities offer programs in the sciences, arts, social sciences, engineering, business, law, and many other areas.

Globalization of Higher Education: In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, higher education became more global, with students and scholars traveling internationally, and universities forming partnerships and collaborations across borders. Online education and digital resources have also transformed the way education is delivered and accessed.

The history of the university system reflects the evolving needs of society, changes in intellectual paradigms, and advances in knowledge. Today, universities continue to be centers of education, research, and cultural development, contributing to the advancement of society and the dissemination of knowledge around the world.

"The university system has a long and rich history that dates back to the Middle Ages. The first universities were established in Europe in the 12th century, and they were initially designed to provide education for priests and monks 1. The University of Bologna, founded in 1088, is considered the oldest university in the world 1. Other early universities include the University of Paris, founded in 1160, and the University of Oxford, founded in 1167 1.

In the early days, universities were primarily focused on teaching theology, law, and medicine 2. However, over time, they began to expand their curricula to include other subjects such as philosophy, science, and the humanities 2.

The modern university system as we know it today began to take shape in the 19th century with the rise of the nation-state 3. Universities began to focus more on research and scholarship, and they became important centers for scientific discovery and innovation 3.

Today, universities play a critical role in society by providing education and training for students, conducting research that advances knowledge and understanding, and serving as engines of economic growth and development 2. They are also important cultural institutions that promote diversity, tolerance, and social progress 2.

In conclusion, the university system has a long and fascinating history that has evolved over time. From its humble beginnings as a place for religious education to its current role as a center for research and innovation, universities have played a vital role in shaping our world.",0

The university system has a long and complex history, dating back to the Middle Ages. The first universities were established in Europe as centers of learning for the clergy and other elite members of society. These universities were typically affiliated with the Catholic Church, and they focused on the study of theology, philosophy, and law.

Over time, the university system began to expand and diversify. New universities were established in other parts of Europe, and they began to offer a wider range of subjects, including medicine, science, and the arts. By the 16th century, the university system had become a major force in European society.

The university system spread to other parts of the world during the Age of Exploration. The first universities in the Americas were established in the 16th century, and they were modeled after the European universities. The university system continued to expand and diversify throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the 20th century, the university system experienced a dramatic growth in enrollment. This was due to a number of factors, including the expansion of secondary education, the increasing demand for skilled workers, and the rising expectations of individuals and societies. Today, there are over 20,000 universities in the world, and they enroll millions of students each year.

The university system has played a major role in shaping the modern world. Universities have produced many of the world's leading thinkers and innovators. They have also played a role in promoting social and economic development.

Here are some of the key milestones in the history of the university system:

1088: The University of Bologna is founded in Italy.
1209: The University of Paris is founded in France.
1229: The University of Oxford is founded in England.

"There are five primary educational learning theories: behaviorism, cognitive, constructivism, humanism, and connectivism. Additional learning theories include transformative, social, and experiential",0
"Several major theories of learning and education have been developed by psychologists and educators to explain how individuals acquire knowledge and skills. These theories provide insights into the learning process and inform instructional strategies. Here are some of the most prominent theories:

Behaviorism:

Key Figures: John B. Watson, B.F. Skinner
Principles: Behaviorism focuses on observable behaviors and the idea that learning occurs through the association of stimuli and responses. Positive and negative reinforcement play a crucial role in shaping behavior.
Cognitive Theory:

Key Figures: Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky
Principles: Cognitive theories emphasize the role of mental processes and internal cognitive structures in learning. Piaget's theory focuses on stages of cognitive development, while Vygotsky's theory emphasizes social interaction and the zone of proximal development.
Constructivism:

Key Figures: Jerome Bruner, Lev Vygotsky (also associated with constructivist ideas)
Principles: Constructivism posits that learning is an active, meaning-making process in which learners construct knowledge and understanding through interactions with the environment and social interactions. It emphasizes problem-solving, discovery, and inquiry-based learning.
Social Learning Theory:

Key Figures: Albert Bandura
Principles: Social learning theory suggests that learning occurs through observation and modeling. It highlights the role of social influences, such as peers and role models, in shaping behavior.
Information Processing Theory:

Key Figures: Richard Atkinson, Richard Shiffrin
Principles: Information processing theory draws parallels between human cognition and computer processing. It focuses on how information is processed, stored, and retrieved in the mind, with an emphasis on memory, attention, and problem-solving.
Experiential Learning:

Key Figures: David Kolb
Principles: Experiential learning theory proposes that learning is most effective when it involves a cycle of concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. It emphasizes hands-on learning and reflection.
Andragogy:

Key Figures: Malcolm Knowles
Principles: Andragogy is the theory of adult learning. It suggests that adults have unique characteristics and needs as learners, such as a desire for self-direction and a need to connect learning to their life experiences.
Multiple Intelligences:

Key Figures: Howard Gardner
Principles: The theory of multiple intelligences posits that intelligence is not a single, general trait but a collection of distinct abilities or intelligences, such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, and interpersonal intelligences. Each individual may have strengths in different areas.
Sociocultural Theory:

Key Figures: Lev Vygotsky
Principles: Sociocultural theory emphasizes the role of cultural and social contexts in learning. It suggests that learning is a social activity and that interactions with more knowledgeable peers or adults contribute to cognitive development.
Connectivism:

Key Figures: George Siemens
Principles: Connectivism is a modern theory that emphasizes the importance of networks and digital technologies in learning. It suggests that learning occurs through connections between information sources and that individuals need to navigate these networks effectively.
These theories of learning and education offer various perspectives on how people learn and develop. They have influenced educational practices and curriculum design, and they continue to be subjects of research and debate in the field of education. In practice, many educators integrate aspects of multiple theories to create effective and flexible teaching strategies that address the diverse needs of learners.

"There are several major theories of learning and education that have been proposed by psychologists and educators. Here are some of the most prominent ones:

Behaviorism: This theory suggests that learning is a result of the interaction between an individual and their environment 1. It emphasizes the role of rewards and punishments in shaping behavior 1.

Cognitive: This theory focuses on how people process information and how they use that information to solve problems and make decisions 1. It emphasizes the role of mental processes such as attention, perception, memory, and reasoning in learning 1.

Constructivism: This theory suggests that learning is an active process in which learners construct new knowledge based on their experiences and prior knowledge 1. It emphasizes the role of social interaction, collaboration, and reflection in learning 1.

Humanism: This theory emphasizes the importance of personal growth, self-actualization, and individual choice in learning 1. It suggests that learners should be encouraged to pursue their interests and passions and to take responsibility for their own learning 1.

Connectivism: This theory suggests that learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources 2. It emphasizes the role of technology and social networks in facilitating learning 2.

These are just a few examples of the many theories that have been proposed to explain learning and education. Each theory has its strengths and weaknesses, and researchers continue to explore new ways to understand this complex topic.",0

There are many different theories of learning and education, but some of the most well-known and influential include:

Behaviorism: Behaviorism is a theory of learning that focuses on observable behaviors. Behaviorists believe that learning is the result of conditioning, which is the process of associating stimuli with responses.
Cognitivism: Cognitivism is a theory of learning that focuses on the internal mental processes involved in learning. Cognitivists believe that learners actively construct their own knowledge and understanding of the world.
Constructivism: Constructivism is a theory of learning that builds on cognitivism and emphasizes the social and collaborative nature of learning. Constructivists believe that learners construct their own knowledge through social interaction and collaboration with others.
Connectivism: Connectivism is a relatively new theory of learning that emphasizes the importance of networks and connections in the learning process. Connectivists believe that learning is not just the acquisition of information, but also the ability to connect and learn from others.
These theories have different implications for education. For example, behaviorism suggests that teachers should use positive reinforcement to encourage desired behaviors and negative reinforcement to discourage undesired behaviors. Cognitivism suggests that teachers should focus on helping learners to develop their cognitive skills, such as problem-solving and critical thinking skills. Constructivism suggests that teachers should create a learning environment where learners can actively construct their own knowledge and understanding. Connectivism suggests that teachers should help learners to develop the skills they need to learn in a networked world.

In practice, many teachers draw on elements from multiple theories of learning and education. For example, a teacher might use behaviorist techniques, such as positive reinforcement, to manage student behavior. They might also use constructivist techniques, such as group projects and hands-on activities, to help students learn. And they might use connectivist techniques, such as online discussions and wikis, to help students learn from each other and from experts around the world.

The best approach to learning and education is the one that works best for the individual learner. By understanding the different theories of learning and education, teachers can create a learning environment that is supportive and conducive to learning for all students.",0

"While some Northeastern communities had already established publicly funded or free schools by the late 1780s, the concept of free public education did not begin to take hold on a wider scale until the 1830s. The new federal government provided encouragement and support for establishing public schools.",0
"The history of public education in the United States is a complex and multifaceted story that has evolved over several centuries. Here is a brief overview of its key milestones and developments:

Colonial Era: Public education in the United States has its roots in the early colonial period. The Massachusetts Bay Colony established the first public school in the 1630s, known as the Boston Latin School, to provide a basic education for the children of colonists. Education in these early schools was primarily focused on religious instruction and basic literacy.

Common Schools: In the 19th century, the concept of ""common schools"" gained popularity. Horace Mann, often considered the father of American public education, advocated for the establishment of publicly funded, nonsectarian schools open to all children. Mann's efforts led to the development of state-supported common schools in Massachusetts and later in other states.

Compulsory Education: In the mid-19th century, many states began passing laws mandating compulsory education, requiring children to attend school. These laws aimed to ensure that all children received at least a basic education.

The Land Grant Act: The Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862 and subsequent legislation led to the creation of land-grant colleges and universities, which were established to provide practical education in agriculture and the mechanical arts. These institutions played a pivotal role in expanding access to higher education.

The Progressive Era: In the early 20th century, the Progressive Movement influenced education by advocating for educational reforms. This period saw a focus on child-centered education, teacher training, and the introduction of modern pedagogical practices.

The Civil Rights Movement: The mid-20th century brought important changes to public education, particularly in addressing issues of racial segregation. The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 declared racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional, leading to the desegregation of schools across the country.

Federal Involvement: The federal government has played an increasing role in education since the mid-20th century. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, later reauthorized as the No Child Left Behind Act and then the Every Student Succeeds Act, aimed to improve education for disadvantaged students and set standards for academic achievement.

Inclusion and Special Education: Laws like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1975 mandated that public schools provide special education services to students with disabilities, promoting inclusivity and accessibility.

Charter Schools and School Choice: The late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen the growth of charter schools, which are publicly funded but operate with more autonomy, and discussions surrounding school choice, allowing parents to select the schools their children attend.

The Digital Age: Advances in technology have led to the integration of digital tools and online learning into public education, creating new opportunities and challenges for educators and students.

Throughout its history, public education in the United States has been shaped by a combination of federal, state, and local initiatives, reflecting changing societal values, political ideologies, and educational philosophies. It continues to be a subject of ongoing debate and reform as the nation strives to provide equitable and high-quality education for all its citizens.

"Public education in the United States has a rich history that dates back to the 17th century. The first American schools in the thirteen original colonies opened in the 17th century. Boston Latin School, founded in 1635, is both the first public school and oldest existing school in the United States 1.

In the early years of the nation, schooling was haphazard. Many children were excluded on the basis of income, race or ethnicity, gender, geographic location, and other reasons. The children who did receive instruction, primarily white children, were educated through a hodgepodge of arrangements such as church-supported schools, local schools organized by towns or groups of parents, tuition schools set up by traveling schoolmasters, charity schools for poor children run by churches or benevolent societies, boarding schools for children of the well-to-do, Ã¢â‚¬Å“dame schoolsÃ¢â‚¬Â run by women in their homes, private tutoring or home schooling, and work apprenticeships with some rudimentary instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic 2.

The path toward providing universal access to free education was gradual and uneven. Throughout the 19th century, public schools took hold at a faster pace in some communities than in others. Public schools were more common in cities than in rural areas and in the Northeast than in other parts of the country 2.

The development of public education system from its roots in Puritan and Congregationalist religious schools in the 1600s to the availability of free elementary education thanks to the efforts of Common School reformers in the 1800s is explored in this essay 3.",0
"The history of public education in the United States can be traced back to the early colonial period. In 1647, the Massachusetts Bay Colony passed a law requiring towns with 50 or more families to establish a grammar school and towns with 100 or more families to establish a Latin school. These schools were intended to provide basic education for boys who would go on to college and become ministers, lawyers, and doctors.

In the early 1800s, there was a growing movement to provide more universal access to education. Horace Mann, a Massachusetts legislator and secretary of the state board of education, was a leading advocate for public education. Mann argued that public schools would help to create a more informed and democratic citizenry.

Under Mann's leadership, Massachusetts became a model for other states in developing a system of public schools. By the mid-1800s, most states had passed compulsory education laws requiring children to attend school for a certain number of years.

Public education in the United States has evolved over time to meet the changing needs of society. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a focus on expanding educational opportunities for girls and minorities. In the mid-20th century, there was a focus on improving the quality of education through standardized testing and accountability measures.

Today, public education is facing a number of challenges, including declining enrollment, increasing costs, and concerns about student achievement. However, public education remains a vital institution in American society. It provides a foundation for learning and citizenship for all children.

Here are some of the key milestones in the history of public education in the United States:

1647: Massachusetts Bay Colony passes a law requiring towns with 50 or more families to establish a grammar school and towns with 100 or more families to establish a Latin school.
1837: Horace Mann is appointed secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education.
1852: Massachusetts passes the first compulsory education law in the United States.
1862: Morrill Land-Grant Act establishes land-grant colleges and universities to provide agricultural and mechanical education.
1870: Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees equal protection under the law to all citizens, including African Americans.
1896: Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court decision upholds the constitutionality of Jim Crow laws that segregated schools and other public facilities.
1954: Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision overturns Plessy v. Ferguson and rules that segregated schools are unconstitutional.
1965: Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is passed, providing federal funding to schools in low-income areas.
1983: A Nation at Risk report is published, calling for reforms to improve the quality of American education.
2001: No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is passed, setting high standards for student achievement and requiring schools to be held accountable for their performance.
2015: The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is passed, replacing NCLB and giving states more flexibility in how they implement education reform.
Public education has played a vital role in American society since its inception. It has helped to create a more informed and democratic citizenry and has provided opportunities for all children to succeed. While public education faces challenges today, it remains a cornerstone of American democracy.",0
"Montessori education recognizes that children learn in different ways, and accommodates all learning styles. Students are also free to learn at their own pace, each advancing through the curriculum as he is ready, guided by the teacher and an individualized learning plan.",0
"Montessori education is a unique educational approach developed by Dr. Maria Montessori in the early 20th century. It is based on a distinct educational philosophy and methodology that emphasizes the following key principles:

Child-Centered Learning: Montessori education places the child at the center of the learning process. It is designed to honor and nurture the natural curiosity and independence of children. The teacher, often referred to as a ""guide"" or ""directress,"" serves as a facilitator and observer of the child's development rather than as a traditional instructor.

Prepared Environment: Montessori classrooms are carefully prepared environments with age-appropriate materials and activities. These materials are designed to be self-correcting, allowing children to learn independently and at their own pace. The environment is organized and aesthetically pleasing, creating a calm and ordered space for learning.

Self-Directed Learning: Montessori encourages children to choose their own activities and work independently. This fosters a sense of autonomy, self-discipline, and responsibility for their learning. Children are encouraged to follow their interests and passions.

Multi-Age Classrooms: Montessori classrooms typically have mixed-age groups, such as 3-6 years, 6-9 years, and 9-12 years. This multi-age setting allows for peer learning and mentorship, promoting cooperation, leadership, and a sense of community.

Hands-On Learning: Montessori materials are designed to be tactile and hands-on. They provide concrete experiences for abstract concepts. Children manipulate objects and engage in sensory activities to understand concepts in subjects like math, language, and science.

Individualized Education: Montessori teachers observe each child's progress and tailor their lessons to the child's individual needs and readiness. This individualized approach ensures that each child can progress at their own pace.

Freedom within Limits: Montessori education provides children with freedom to choose their work, but this freedom is guided by certain limits and rules. Children learn to respect the rights and needs of others and the environment. This structure helps develop self-discipline.

"The Montessori education philosophy is an approach to education that was created by Maria Montessori, an Italian physician and educator 1. It is based on the belief that children are natural learners who have a desire to explore and discover new things at their own pace. The Montessori method emphasizes individualized learning, self-motivation, independence, and personal development. It uses special materials and a prepared environment to facilitate learning. It also involves mixed-age classrooms and three-hour time blocks for activities 1.

The Montessori method is based on three main principles: respect for the child, the prepared environment, and the use of special materials 2. In a Montessori classroom, children are given the freedom to move around and explore. The teacher acts as a guide, providing support and encouragement as needed 2.

MontessoriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s philosophy is grounded in the idea that children learn best when they are free to explore their environment and learn at their own pace 1. The Montessori method emphasizes hands-on learning, allowing children to use their senses to explore the world around them 3. The goal of Montessori education is to help children develop independence, self-confidence, and a love of learning that will last a lifetime 3.

In summary, the Montessori education philosophy is based on the belief that children are natural learners who have a desire to explore and discover new things at their own pace. The Montessori method emphasizes individualized learning, self-motivation, independence, and personal development. It uses special materials and a prepared environment to facilitate learning. The goal of Montessori education is to help children develop independence, self-confidence, and a love of learning that will last a lifetime.



Montessori Education: The Philosophy and How It Works",0
"
The Montessori philosophy of education is based on the belief that children are naturally curious and eager to learn. Montessori educators believe that children learn best through hands-on experiences and self-directed exploration.

The Montessori classroom is designed to be a supportive and stimulating environment where children can learn at their own pace and in their own way. Montessori classrooms are typically mixed-age, which allows children to learn from and support each other.

Some of the key principles of Montessori education include:

Respect for the child: Montessori educators believe that children are individuals with their own unique needs and interests. They respect children's autonomy and allow them to make choices about their own learning.
The prepared environment: The Montessori classroom is carefully designed to provide children with the materials and resources they need to learn. The environment is also structured in a way that allows children to move freely and explore at their own pace.
Hands-on learning: Montessori educators believe that children learn best through hands-on experiences. The classroom is filled with manipulatives and other materials that allow children to explore concepts and learn through their senses.
Self-directed learning: Montessori educators believe that children are naturally motivated to learn. They provide children with opportunities to set their own goals and work independently on their own projects.
Social interaction: Montessori classrooms are designed to promote social interaction and cooperation among children. Children are encouraged to help each other and learn from each other.
Montessori education has been shown to be effective in helping children develop a love of learning and a strong foundation in academic skills. Montessori students are also often more independent, confident, and socially skilled than students in traditional classrooms.

Here are some specific examples of how Montessori principles are put into practice in the classroom:

Children are free to choose their own activities. Montessori classrooms typically have a variety of materials and activities available, and children are free to choose what they want to work on.
Children work at their own pace. Montessori teachers provide guidance and support, but they do not micromanage children's learning. Children are allowed to work at their own pace and take breaks when they need them.
Children work collaboratively. Montessori classrooms encourage children to work together on projects and activities. Children learn from each other and support each other's learning.
Children are given real-world experiences. Montessori classrooms use hands-on materials and activities to help children learn about the world around them. For example, children might learn about math by measuring ingredients for a recipe or learn about science by dissecting a frog.
Montessori education is a unique and effective approach to education that can help children reach their full potential.

"Climate change is a long-term shift in the average weather conditions of a region, such as its typical temperature, rainfall, and windiness. Climate change means that the range of conditions expected in many regions will change over the coming decades.",0
"Climate change is a long-term alteration in the Earth's average weather patterns, including temperature, precipitation, and wind. It refers to significant and lasting changes in these patterns that occur over extended periods, often decades to millions of years, as opposed to short-term fluctuations in weather. Climate change is primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other industrial processes, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, leading to a gradual warming of the planet. This warming effect is commonly referred to as global warming.

Key concepts and components of climate change include:

Greenhouse Effect: This is the natural process by which certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping back into space. This process is necessary for maintaining a habitable temperature on Earth.

Enhanced Greenhouse Effect: Human activities have increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, intensifying the natural greenhouse effect. This leads to an increase in average global temperatures.

Global Warming: The term refers to the long-term increase in the Earth's average temperature due to the enhanced greenhouse effect.

Climate Variability: Climate change encompasses not only a gradual increase in temperature but also changes in weather patterns, such as more frequent and severe storms, altered precipitation patterns, and shifts in wind patterns.

Sea Level Rise: As global temperatures rise, polar ice caps and glaciers melt, leading to an increase in sea levels. This can result in coastal erosion and the inundation of low-lying areas.

Extreme Weather Events: Climate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall.

Ocean Acidification: Increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere also lead to the absorption of more CO2 by the world's oceans, causing them to become more acidic. This has detrimental effects on marine ecosystems and species.

Impacts on Ecosystems: Climate change can disrupt ecosystems by altering temperature and precipitation patterns. This affects the distribution and behavior of plant and animal species, leading to ecosystem shifts and loss of biodiversity.

Human Impacts: Climate change has wide-ranging consequences for human society, including threats to food security, water resources, infrastructure, and health. Vulnerable communities are disproportionately affected.

Mitigation and Adaptation: Efforts to address climate change typically fall into two categories: mitigation, which involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions to slow the rate of climate change, and adaptation, which focuses on preparing for and responding to the changes that are already occurring.

Understanding and addressing climate change is a global challenge that requires international cooperation, policy initiatives, sustainable practices, and changes in individual behaviors. Scientists and experts study climate change to better predict its impacts and develop strategies for mitigating its effects and adapting to the changes it brings.

"Climate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term 1. Climate change is driven by human activities, particularly fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atmosphere, raising EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s average surface temperature. Natural processes, which have been overwhelmed by human activities, can also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (e.g., cyclical ocean patterns like El NiÃƒÂ±o, La NiÃƒÂ±a and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and external forcings (e.g., volcanic activity, changes in the SunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s energy output, variations in EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orbit) 1.

The effects of climate change are widespread and include rising sea levels, melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and floods, as well as changes in precipitation patterns and storm intensity 1. Climate change also has significant impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. For example, it can lead to habitat loss for many species and alter the timing of seasonal events such as bird migration and flowering of plants 1.

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to note that climate change is not a new phenomenon. The EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s climate has been changing for millions of years due to natural causes such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s orbit around the Sun. However, what is different about current climate change is the rate at which it is occurring and the fact that it is largely driven by human activities 1.

In summary, climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that have come to define EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s local, regional and global climates. It is driven by human activities such as fossil fuel burning and has significant impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. The effects of climate change are widespread and include rising sea levels, melting glaciers and ice caps, more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods, as well as changes in precipitation patterns and storm intensity.",0

Climate change is a long-term shift in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects that are synonymous with the term. Climate change is caused by factors including oceanic processes (such as oceanic circulation), variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions, and human-induced alterations of the natural world.

The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term global warming, though the latter refers specifically to the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system and its associated effects.

The primary cause of climate change since the pre-industrial period is human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with the term global warming, though the latter refers specifically to the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system and its associated effects.

The impacts of climate change are already being felt around the world, and are expected to become more severe in the future. Some of the observed and expected impacts of climate change include:

Rising sea levels
More extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and storms
Changes in agricultural yields
Loss of biodiversity
Impacts on human health
The good news is that it is not too late to take action on climate change. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change and protect our planet for future generations.

Here are some things that individuals can do to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change:

Drive less and walk, bike, or take public transportation more often
Use energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs
Turn off lights and appliances when you're not using them
Weatherize your home to make it more energy-efficient
Eat less meat and more plant-based foods
Recycle and compost
Support businesses and organizations that are working to reduce their environmental impact
By taking these steps, we can all make a difference in the fight against climate change.",0
"Direct causes of deforestation are agricultural expansion, wood extraction (e.g., logging or wood harvest for domestic fuel or charcoal), and infrastructure expansion such as road building and urbanization.",0
"Deforestation is the process of clearing or removing forests or trees from a particular area, resulting in the loss of forest cover. Several factors contribute to deforestation, and they often vary by region. The primary causes of deforestation include:

Agriculture: One of the most significant drivers of deforestation is the conversion of forests into agricultural land. Forests are often cleared to make way for crop cultivation, pasture for livestock, and commercial agriculture such as palm oil, soy, and rubber plantations.

Logging and Timber Production: The demand for timber and wood products drives deforestation. Logging operations, legal and illegal, result in the removal of large areas of forests. Clear-cutting, where entire sections of forests are harvested, can have particularly devastating effects on ecosystems.

Infrastructure Development: The construction of roads, highways, and other infrastructure projects can lead to deforestation. These projects open up remote areas for settlement, logging, and agriculture, and the associated infrastructure can fragment forests and disrupt ecosystems.

Mining: The mining industry often necessitates the clearing of forests to access minerals and resources. This not only results in deforestation but also leads to habitat destruction and pollution.

Urbanization and Land Use Change: As populations grow, urban areas expand into forested regions, resulting in the loss of forest cover. Land development, housing, and commercial construction contribute to deforestation in and around urban centers.

Fire: Forest fires, both natural and human-induced, can lead to deforestation. In some cases, fires are set intentionally to clear land for agriculture or other purposes.

Cattle Ranching: Cattle ranching, especially in countries like Brazil, has been a major driver of deforestation. Forests are often cleared to create pasture for livestock, contributing to the loss of biodiversity and carbon emissions.

Illegal Activities: Illegal logging and land encroachment are significant drivers of deforestation in many regions. These activities often occur due to weak enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.

Climate Change: Changing climate patterns can lead to increased incidence of pests and diseases in forests, which can result in forest degradation and deforestation as damaged trees are felled.

Infrastructure Development: The construction of dams, irrigation systems, and other infrastructure projects can result in the inundation of forests and displacement of local communities.

Shift to Monoculture Plantations: In some cases, natural forests are replaced with monoculture plantations for commercial crops like oil palm, eucalyptus, and rubber. These plantations lack the biodiversity of natural forests and may contribute to deforestation.

Deforestation has serious environmental consequences, including the loss of biodiversity, disruption of ecosystems, and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to global climate change. Efforts to combat deforestation typically involve a combination of policies, conservation strategies, and sustainable land-use practices to mitigate its impact and promote reforestation and afforestation (the planting of new trees) to restore forested areas.

"Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees from a forest. The main causes of deforestation are:

Agriculture: Agriculture, including animal agriculture and crop agriculture, accounts for around 85% of deforestation worldwide. In Malaysia and Indonesia, forests are cut down to make way for producing palm oil 123.
Illegal logging: Illegal logging is another major cause of deforestation. It is estimated that illegal logging accounts for up to 30% of the global timber trade 1.
Mining: Mining in tropical forests is on the rise due to an ever-increasing demand for minerals 2.
Drilling: Drilling for oil and gas can also lead to deforestation 1.
Forestry practices: Unsustainable forestry practices such as clear-cutting, selective logging, and monoculture plantations can also contribute to deforestation 1.
Wildfires: Wildfires can destroy millions of hectares of forest every year 2.
Urbanization: As human population grows, large swaths of forest get cleared to make way for the expansion of cities and settlements 2.
Overpopulation: Overpopulation can lead to increased demand for resources such as food, fuel, and shelter, which can result in deforestation 2.
Climate change: Climate change is a leading cause of deforestation. Extreme weather events like wildfires, droughts, and storm surges destroy millions of hectares of forest every year 2.",0
"
The main causes of deforestation are:

Agriculture: Agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation, accounting for around 80% of global deforestation. This includes the clearing of forests for cropland, pastureland, and plantations.
Logging: Logging is another major cause of deforestation. Trees are harvested for their timber, which is used for a variety of purposes, including construction, furniture, and paper.
Urbanization: Urbanization is the expansion of cities and towns. As cities grow, they encroach on forests, clearing them for development.
Mining: Mining is the extraction of minerals from the earth. Mining operations can destroy forests, both directly and indirectly. For example, mines can clear forests to make way for mining equipment and infrastructure.
Forest fires: Forest fires can also cause deforestation. Forest fires can be started by natural causes, such as lightning strikes, or by human activities, such as arson or negligence.
Other causes of deforestation include:

Fuelwood collection: Fuelwood is wood that is burned for fuel, such as cooking and heating. Fuelwood collection can be a major cause of deforestation in developing countries.
Infrastructure development: Infrastructure development, such as road building and dam construction, can also lead to deforestation.
Subsistence agriculture: Subsistence agriculture is farming that is done to produce food for the farmer and their family. Subsistence agriculture can lead to deforestation when farmers clear forests to create new farmland.
Deforestation has a number of negative consequences, including:

Loss of biodiversity: Forests are home to a wide variety of plants and animals. Deforestation destroys these habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity.
Climate change: Forests play an important role in regulating the climate. Deforestation releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change.
Soil erosion: Deforestation can lead to soil erosion. When trees are removed, the soil is no longer held in place by their roots. This can lead to landslides and other problems.
Water pollution: Deforestation can also lead to water pollution. When trees are removed, the soil is more likely to be washed into rivers and streams. This can pollute the water and make it unsafe to drink.
It is important to note that deforestation is a complex problem with a variety of causes. There is no single solution to the problem. However, there are a number of things that can be done to reduce deforestation, such as:

Sustainable forest management: Sustainable forest management is the practice of managing forests in a way that protects them for future generations. This includes harvesting trees at a sustainable rate and replanting trees after they are harvested.
Reducing demand for products that contribute to deforestation: Consumers can reduce demand for products that contribute to deforestation by choosing products that are certified sustainable.
Supporting policies that protect forests: Governments can play a role in protecting forests by passing and enforcing laws that protect forests from deforestation.

"Sustainable agriculture is a farming and land management approach that focuses on meeting the current and future needs for food, fiber, and other agricultural products while simultaneously addressing environmental, social, and economic concerns. It aims to balance agricultural practices with the health of ecosystems, the well-being of communities, and the profitability of farming operations. Sustainable agriculture involves various principles and practices, including:

Environmental Conservation: Sustainable agriculture seeks to minimize negative impacts on the environment. This includes practices like reduced pesticide and chemical fertilizer use, minimal soil disturbance, and the preservation of natural habitats within or near agricultural areas. By reducing environmental harm, sustainable agriculture helps protect biodiversity, water quality, and soil health.

Soil Health: Healthy soil is essential for sustainable agriculture. Practices like crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage help improve soil structure, fertility, and moisture retention, reducing the need for synthetic inputs and promoting long-term sustainability.

Water Management: Sustainable agriculture emphasizes efficient water use. Techniques such as drip irrigation, rainwater harvesting, and the maintenance of buffer zones along water bodies help conserve water resources and reduce pollution of waterways.

Biodiversity: Maintaining biodiversity is crucial in sustainable agriculture. It includes planting a variety of crops, preserving native vegetation, and creating wildlife habitat on agricultural lands. A diverse landscape can provide natural pest control and pollination services, reducing the need for chemical pesticides.

Crop Diversity: Sustainable agriculture encourages diversification of crops rather than relying on monoculture. A mix of crops helps reduce pest and disease pressure, enhances soil fertility, and supports a more resilient food system.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM): IPM is a key component of sustainable agriculture. It involves monitoring pests and diseases, using natural predators, and only using chemical control methods when necessary. This minimizes the environmental impact of pesticides.

Organic Farming: Many sustainable agriculture practices align with organic farming principles, which prioritize soil health and reduce the use of synthetic chemicals. Organic farming typically avoids genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and synthetic pesticides and fertilizers.

Energy Efficiency: Sustainable agriculture aims to reduce energy consumption by optimizing transportation, energy-efficient machinery, and the use of renewable energy sources on farms.

Economic Viability: Sustainable agriculture seeks to maintain the economic well-being of farmers and rural communities. It emphasizes fair wages for labor, equitable trade practices, and access to markets for small and local farmers.

Community and Social Well-Being: Sustainable agriculture promotes social equity by supporting local communities, providing access to nutritious food, and prioritizing the well-being of farmworkers.

Resilience and Adaptation: As sustainable agriculture takes a long-term view, it focuses on building resilience in agricultural systems to cope with challenges like climate change and shifting market dynamics.

Sustainable agriculture is seen as a way to address the environmental and social challenges associated with conventional farming practices. It recognizes that agriculture is intimately connected to the health of ecosystems and communities and seeks to find solutions that work for both the present and future generations. Many certification programs and initiatives exist to promote and verify sustainable agricultural practices, such as USDA Organic, Fair Trade, and the Rainforest Alliance.

"Sustainable agriculture is a farming system that aims to provide the resources necessary for present human populations while conserving the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to sustain future generations 1. It is a holistic approach to farming that prioritizes Ã¢â‚¬Å“planetary health,Ã¢â‚¬Â the idea that the stability of the planet determines human well-being 1.

Sustainable agriculture seeks to address the drawbacks of modern industrial agriculture, including the degradation of ecosystems and related biodiversity loss, a loss of crop diversity, numerous animal welfare concerns, and human health risks 1. Its basic tenets include promoting socioeconomic equity, earning profit, and maintaining ecosystem health 1.

Sustainable agriculture emphasizes planting diverse crops, including heirloom plants, which are often suited to a regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s particular climate. Rather than relying on a single crop in industrial monoculture, sustainable agriculture advocates the use of polyculture, in which multiple crops are grown together. Although polyculture is frequently more labor-intensive than industrial monoculture, it can reduce the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers and generally improves soil quality 1. Similarly, crop rotation can help preserve soil productivity and lessen the need for agricultural chemicals for fertilization and pest control. The use of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, smother crops, and green manures can help restore soils and reduce erosion. Composting crop residues and other agricultural wastes helps recycle nutrients back to the farmland 1.

Animal agriculture is also an important aspect of sustainable agriculture. Sustainable animal agriculture practices include providing animals with adequate space, access to pasture or outdoor areas, and proper nutrition. Sustainable animal agriculture also emphasizes reducing waste and pollution from animal production 1.

In summary, sustainable agriculture is a farming system that aims to provide resources for present human populations while conserving the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to sustain future generations. It emphasizes planting diverse crops suited to a regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s particular climate, using polyculture instead of monoculture, crop rotation, composting crop residues and other agricultural wastes, and sustainable animal agriculture practices.",0

"Ecological life supportÃ¢â‚¬â€biodiversity provides functioning ecosystems that supply oxygen, clean air and water, pollination of plants, pest control, wastewater treatment and many ecosystem services.",0
"Biodiversity, short for biological diversity, refers to the variety of life on Earth, including the diversity of species, genetic diversity within species, and the variety of ecosystems. Biodiversity is of paramount importance for a range of ecological, economic, social, and cultural reasons:

Ecosystem Stability: Biodiversity contributes to the stability and resilience of ecosystems. Diverse ecosystems are often better able to resist and recover from disturbances, such as diseases, climate change, and natural disasters. They also provide critical services, such as pollination, water purification, and soil fertility, that are essential for human survival.

Genetic Resources: Genetic diversity within species is crucial for their adaptability and survival. It allows for the development of new traits and adaptations, helping species cope with environmental changes and threats like diseases. Many of the crops and livestock we rely on for food and agriculture depend on genetic diversity.

Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Advancements: Biodiversity is a valuable source of medicinal plants and potential pharmaceutical compounds. Many of the world's most widely used medicines have their origins in plants, animals, or microorganisms. Biodiversity is, therefore, critical for advances in medicine and human health.

Economic Benefits: Biodiversity plays a substantial role in economies around the world. Industries like agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and tourism are heavily dependent on biodiversity. Healthy ecosystems provide resources and services that support these industries and contribute to livelihoods and economic growth.

Cultural and Aesthetic Values: Biodiversity is often deeply ingrained in the cultural, spiritual, and recreational aspects of human societies. Many indigenous cultures and local communities have strong connections to specific ecosystems and the species within them. Biodiversity also contributes to the aesthetic and recreational value of natural landscapes.

Scientific and Educational Value: Biodiversity is a source of fascination for scientists and provides invaluable insights into the functioning of life on Earth. It offers opportunities for research and discovery, contributing to our understanding of ecology, evolution, and genetics. Biodiversity education is also essential for raising awareness and promoting conservation efforts.

Regulation of Climate and Disease: Ecosystems help regulate climate by sequestering carbon and influencing weather patterns. They also act as buffers against the spread of diseases by maintaining balances in predator-prey relationships and limiting the proliferation of disease vectors.

Food Security: Biodiversity is crucial for global food security. It provides a wide range of food sources, including plants, animals, and aquatic life. A diverse food supply is more resilient to pests, diseases, and climate fluctuations, reducing the risk of food shortages.

Pollination: Many of the world's food crops and wild plants rely on pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and birds, for reproduction. Biodiversity supports pollinators, helping ensure agricultural productivity and food availability.

Water Resources: Biodiversity plays a role in regulating water availability and quality. Healthy forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems help control runoff, reduce soil erosion, and filter pollutants, benefiting water resources and supply.

Efforts to conserve and protect biodiversity are critical for sustaining the planet's health and the well-being of all living organisms, including humans. Many organizations, governments, and initiatives are dedicated to preserving biodiversity through habitat conservation, species protection, sustainable resource management, and public education. The loss of biodiversity, primarily due to habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and invasive species, poses significant challenges and underscores the urgency of global conservation efforts.",0
"Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, including the diversity of species, ecosystems, and genetic diversity within species. Biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans. Without a wide range of animals, plants, and microorganisms, we cannot have healthy ecosystems that provide us with the air we breathe and the food we eat 1.

Biodiversity also has intrinsic value. Many aspects of biodiversity are instinctively widely valued by people, but the more we study biodiversity, the more we see that all of it is important Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even bugs and bacteria that we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see or may not like the look of 1.

Biodiversity has many benefits for humans. Pollinators such as birds, bees, and other insects are estimated to be responsible for a third of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crop production. Without pollinators, we would not have apples, cherries, blueberries, almonds, and many other foods we eat. Agriculture is also reliant upon invertebrates Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they help to maintain the health of the soil crops grow in. Soil is teeming with microbes that are vital for liberating nutrients that plants need to grow, which are then also passed to us when we eat them. Life from the oceans provides the main source of animal protein for many people. Trees and other plants clean the air we breathe and help us tackle the global challenge of climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide. Coral reefs and mangrove forests act as natural defenses protecting coastlines from waves and storms. Many of our medicines, along with other complex chemicals that we use in our daily lives such as latex and rubber, also originate from plants 1.

In summary, biodiversity is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans. It has intrinsic value and provides many benefits for humans such as pollination of crops, maintenance of soil health, provision of animal protein from oceans, cleaning air by trees and other plants, acting as natural defenses protecting coastlines from waves and storms.",0
"
Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth. It includes all of the different plants, animals, and microorganisms that live on our planet. Biodiversity is important for a number of reasons, including:

It provides essential ecosystem services. Biodiversity helps to provide ecosystem services that are essential for human survival, such as clean air and water, pollination, and pest control. For example, bees pollinate many of the crops that we eat, and ladybugs eat aphids, which are a pest for many crops.
It supports food security. Biodiversity provides us with a wide variety of food sources. This means that if one food source is disrupted, we have others to rely on. For example, if there is a drought that destroys the wheat crop, we can still eat other crops, such as rice or potatoes.
It provides medicinal resources. Biodiversity is a source of many of the medicines that we use. For example, aspirin is derived from the willow tree bark, and quinine, which is used to treat malaria, is derived from the cinchona tree.
It is essential for climate regulation. Biodiversity helps to regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, forests play a major role in carbon storage.
It has cultural and aesthetic value. Biodiversity is an important part of many cultures and religions. It also provides us with opportunities for recreation and enjoyment. For example, many people enjoy hiking, camping, and birdwatching in natural areas.
Overall, biodiversity is essential for human well-being. It provides us with the resources and services that we need to survive and thrive.

Here are some specific examples of the benefits of biodiversity:

Bees pollinate many of the fruits and vegetables that we eat. Without bees, we would have less food to eat.
Mangrove forests protect coastal communities from storms and flooding.
Cor reefs provide important habitat for fish and other marine life.
Forests help to regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Plants produce oxygen that we breathe.
Microorganisms help to decompose waste and recycle nutrients.
Biodiversity is essential for a healthy planet and for human well-being. We must do everything we can to protect and conserve biodiversity.",0

"
The Bible is the central religious text of Christianity. It is a collection of writings that Christians believe to be inspired by God and to contain his revelation to humanity. The Bible is divided into two main parts: the Old Testament and the New Testament.

The Old Testament is the Hebrew Bible, and it contains the sacred texts of Judaism. It tells the story of creation, the fall of humanity, and the history of the Jewish people. The New Testament is the Christian Bible, and it contains the accounts of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, as well as the teachings of the early church.

The Bible is significant to Christianity for a number of reasons. First, it provides the foundation for Christian beliefs and practices. Christians believe that the Bible contains the truth about God, humanity, and the world. They also believe that the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus Christ, which are the blueprint for a good and moral life.

Second, the Bible is a source of comfort and inspiration for Christians. It provides stories of hope, faith, and love. It also contains guidance on how to deal with difficult times and challenges.

Third, the Bible is a powerful tool for evangelism and discipleship. Christians use the Bible to share the good news of Jesus Christ with others and to help new believers grow in their faith.

Here are some of the specific ways in which the Bible is significant to Christianity:

The Bible teaches about the one true God, who is the creator of the universe and the source of all life.
The Bible teaches about Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and the Savior of the world.
The Bible teaches about the Holy Spirit, who is the third person of the Trinity and who empowers Christians to live a holy life.
The Bible teaches about the plan of salvation, which is God's plan to save humanity from sin and death.
The Bible teaches about the Christian life, which is a life lived in obedience to Jesus Christ and in service to others.
The Bible is a complex and rich book, and it can be studied and interpreted in many different ways. However, all Christians agree that it is the inspired word of God and that it is essential to their faith.",0
"In Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Buddhist philosophies, karma denotes the cycle of cause and effect. Like causes produce similar effects. For instance, right actions produce good results while wrong actions produce bad ones.",0
"The concept of karma is central to both Hinduism and Buddhism, although it can have somewhat different interpretations in each religion. In both traditions, karma refers to the idea that one's actions have consequences, and these consequences affect one's present and future experiences. Here's a closer look at how karma is understood in Hinduism and Buddhism:

In Hinduism:

Law of Cause and Effect: Karma is often described as the law of cause and effect. It means that every action (karma) has a corresponding reaction or consequence.
Cycle of Reincarnation: In Hinduism, karma is closely tied to the cycle of reincarnation (samsara). One's actions in a particular lifetime influence the circumstances and experiences of the next life. Positive actions lead to a better future, while negative actions result in a more challenging future.
Types of Karma: Hinduism categorizes karma into different types, including sanchita karma (accumulated karma from past lives), prarabdha karma (karma from past lives that is currently being experienced), and kriyamana karma (current actions that generate future karma). Good actions generate punya (positive karma), while bad actions generate papa (negative karma).
Dharma: The concept of dharma is closely related to karma in Hinduism. Dharma refers to one's duty, righteousness, and moral responsibilities. Acting in accordance with one's dharma is considered a way to generate positive karma.
Moksha: The ultimate goal in Hinduism is to attain moksha, which is liberation from the cycle of reincarnation and the end of the karmic cycle. Achieving moksha is often associated with realizing one's divine nature and merging with the divine (Brahman).
In Buddhism:

Causality: In Buddhism, karma is also seen as a law of cause and effect, where actions have consequences. However, Buddhism places more emphasis on the mental and volitional aspects of karma, considering intentions and motivations to be significant factors.
No-Self (Anatta): Buddhism teaches the concept of anatta, or no-self, which implies that there is no unchanging, permanent self (atman). Therefore, the idea of karma is not tied to an eternal soul. Actions and their consequences affect an individual's current and future experiences but do not involve a fixed self.
Samsara and Rebirth: Like Hinduism, Buddhism acknowledges the cycle of samsara, where beings are reborn after death. However, in Buddhism, the goal is to break free from samsara, not to improve one's karma to attain a better future life.
Noble Eightfold Path: Buddhism offers a path to liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. The Noble Eightfold Path, which includes right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, and right livelihood, guides individuals on a moral and ethical way of life that generates positive karma.
Nirvana: The ultimate aim in Buddhism is to attain nirvana, a state of liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. Nirvana is achieved through the cessation of craving, ignorance, and the root causes of suffering.
In summary, both Hinduism and Buddhism embrace the concept of karma as the law of cause and effect. However, they differ in their understanding of the self (atman vs. anatta), the ultimate goal (moksha vs. nirvana), and the role of karma in the cycle of reincarnation. In Hinduism, karma is a means to achieve a better future life and eventual moksha, while in Buddhism, karma is a factor in the cycle of rebirth that must be transcended to attain nirvana and liberation from suffering.",0
"Karma is a core concept in both Hinduism and Buddhism. It is a Sanskrit word that roughly translates to Ã¢â‚¬Å“actionÃ¢â‚¬Â 1. Karma denotes the cycle of cause and effect, where each action a person takes will affect him or her at some time in the future. Karma is closely linked to the concept of rebirth in Hinduism and Buddhism, where a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actions in this life will determine their future rebirths. Good actions will lead to a better rebirth, while bad actions will lead to a worse rebirth. Ultimately, the goal is to break the cycle of rebirth and achieve spiritual liberation 1.

However, there are some differences in how karma is perceived in Hinduism and Buddhism. In Hinduism, karma is seen as a cosmic law that governs all existence, while in Buddhism, karma is seen as a psychological phenomenon that affects the individual 2. In Hinduism, karma can be both good and bad, while in Buddhism, karma is seen as something that needs to be transcended altogether 2.

In summary, karma is a core concept in both Hinduism and Buddhism that denotes the cycle of cause and effect. It is closely linked to the concept of rebirth in both religions. However, there are some differences in how karma is perceived in Hinduism and Buddhism.",0

"Islam is one of the world's major monotheistic religions, and its core beliefs and practices are outlined in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, and the Hadith, which contains the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. The key tenets of Islam include:

Monotheism (Tawhid): The central and most fundamental belief in Islam is the concept of tawhid, the belief in the absolute oneness of God (Allah). There is no deity except Allah, and Allah is the Creator, Sustainer, and Ruler of the universe. This monotheism is expressed in the Shahada, the Islamic declaration of faith: ""There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.""

Prophethood: Muslims believe that God has sent prophets to guide humanity throughout history. The final prophet is Muhammad, who received divine revelations through the angel Gabriel. His mission was to convey the message of Islam to humanity and complete God's guidance.

Revelation (Quran): The Quran is considered the word of God as revealed to Muhammad over a period of approximately 23 years. It is the primary source of Islamic teachings and serves as a guide for faith, morality, worship, and all aspects of life.

Angels: Muslims believe in the existence of angels created by God to carry out His commands. Angels are beings of light and do not have free will, unlike humans and jinn.

Day of Judgment: Muslims believe in the Day of Judgment, when every individual will be resurrected and held accountable for their actions. They will be judged by God based on their deeds, and their ultimate destination in the afterlife, either Paradise (Jannah) or Hell (Jahannam), will be determined.

Divine Decree (Qadar): Islam teaches that God has complete knowledge and control over everything in the universe. His divine decree encompasses everything, including human free will. Muslims believe that while God knows what will happen, humans have free will to make choices, for which they will be held accountable.

Prayer (Salat): Muslims are required to pray five times a day facing the Kaaba in Mecca. These daily prayers serve as a means of connecting with God, seeking His guidance, and expressing devotion. Prayer times are at dawn (Fajr), midday (Dhuhr), mid-afternoon (Asr), sunset (Maghrib), and night (Isha).

Almsgiving (Zakat): Muslims are obligated to give a portion of their wealth to those in need, typically 2.5% of their accumulated wealth each year. Zakat is considered an act of charity and a means of supporting the less fortunate.

Fasting (Sawm): During the Islamic month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Fasting involves abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours. The fast is a means of self-purification, self-discipline, and empathy for those who are less fortunate.

Pilgrimage (Hajj): Muslims who are physically and financially able are required to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. The Hajj is an annual event during which millions of Muslims gather in Mecca to perform specific rituals, commemorating the actions of Abraham and his family.

These key tenets form the core of Islamic beliefs and practices, serving as a foundation for the faith and way of life of Muslims around the world. While these principles are universal, interpretations and practices can vary among different sects and cultural contexts within the Islamic tradition.

"ranscendentalism is a 19th-century movement of writers and philosophers in New England who were loosely bound together by adherence to an idealistic system of thought based on a belief in the essential unity of all creation, the innate goodness of humanity, and the supremacy of insight over logic and experience for ...",0
"Transcendentalism is a philosophical and literary movement that emerged in the 1830s in the United States, primarily in New England. It is often associated with figures like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau and is characterized by a focus on individual intuition, spirituality, and the inherent goodness of both people and nature. The philosophy of transcendentalism can be summarized by several key principles:

Intuition and Individualism: Transcendentalism places a strong emphasis on the individual's ability to access profound spiritual and moral truths through intuition and personal experience. It values individual insight and self-reliance and encourages people to trust their own inner guidance.

Oversoul: Transcendentalists believe in the existence of an ""Oversoul"" or ""Universal Spirit."" This universal force connects all living things and is a source of inspiration, wisdom, and moral guidance. Individuals can tap into the Oversoul through introspection and self-awareness.

Nature: Nature is central to transcendentalist philosophy. It is seen as a source of spiritual insight and renewal. Transcendentalists believe that by immersing oneself in nature, one can experience a closer connection with the divine and gain a deeper understanding of the self.

Simplicity and Self-Reliance: Transcendentalists advocate for a simple and uncluttered lifestyle. They emphasize self-reliance and the importance of living authentically, free from societal pressures and materialism.

Nonconformity: Transcendentalists encourage nonconformity and the rejection of conventional norms and traditions, especially those that stifle individuality and creativity. They value original thought and actions.

Social Reform: While transcendentalism often emphasizes individualism, it is not completely detached from societal concerns. Many transcendentalists were also involved in social reform movements, such as the abolition of slavery, women's rights, and education reform. They believed that by improving society, individuals could better realize their potential.

The Individual and the Universe: Transcendentalists see a profound connection between the individual and the universe. They believe that by understanding one's own place in the universe, individuals can experience a sense of unity with all of creation.

Prominent transcendentalists include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and Amos Bronson Alcott. Emerson's essay ""Nature"" and his work ""Self-Reliance"" are among the most influential writings of the movement. Thoreau's ""Walden"" and ""Civil Disobedience"" also reflect transcendentalist principles.

Transcendentalism had a significant impact on American literature, philosophy, and culture in the mid-19th century and played a role in shaping the broader transcendentalist movement in the United States. While it waned as a formal philosophical movement by the late 19th century, its ideas continue to influence American thought and have left a lasting legacy in literature, spirituality, and environmentalism.

"Transcendentalism is a philosophical movement that originated in New England in the late 1820s and 1830s. It is based on the belief that people have inherent goodness and that nature is a manifestation of the divine. Transcendentalists believed in the importance of self-reliance, individualism, and intuition over reason and empirical evidence 1.

Transcendentalists believed that people could transcend the limitations of their senses and achieve a higher spiritual state through contemplation of nature and the divine. They believed that people should follow their own instincts and intuition rather than conforming to societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expectations 1.

Transcendentalism had a significant impact on American literature and culture. Transcendentalist writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Walt Whitman emphasized individualism, self-reliance, and the importance of nature in their works 1.

Transcendentalism is a philosophical movement that developed in the United States in the early 19th century. Transcendentalists believed that people have a direct connection to God and nature, and that they can find truth and meaning through intuition and personal experience.

Some of the key tenets of transcendentalism include:

Individualism: Transcendentalists believed that each individual is unique and has the potential to be divine. They emphasized the importance of self-reliance and self-expression.
Idealism: Transcendentalists believed that the ideal world is perfect and spiritual, while the material world is imperfect and illusory. They sought to transcend the material world and connect with the ideal world through intuition and personal experience.
Nature: Transcendentalists believed that nature is a manifestation of God and that it can teach us about ourselves and the world around us. They spent a great deal of time in nature and wrote extensively about its beauty and power.
Reform: Transcendentalists were social reformers who believed in the importance of human progress and social justice. They advocated for many causes, including abolitionism, women's rights, and educational reform.
Some of the most famous transcendentalists include Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and Nathaniel Hawthorne.

Transcendentalism had a significant impact on American culture and literature. It helped to shape the American ideal of individualism and self-reliance. It also inspired many American writers and artists to create works that celebrated nature and the human spirit.

Here are some specific examples of how transcendentalism has influenced American culture and literature:

Emerson's essay ""Self-Reliance"" is considered to be one of the most important essays on American individualism.
Thoreau's book Walden is a classic of American nature writing and a celebration of the simple life.
Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter explores themes of sin, guilt, and redemption from a transcendentalist perspective.
Walt Whitman's poetry celebrates the individual and the natural world.
The transcendentalist movement also inspired the development of American Unitarianism, a liberal form of Christianity.
Transcendentalism remains an important part of American culture and literature today. It continues to inspire people to live authentic and meaningful lives.

"Many religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam, and many pagan belief systems, or reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a consequence of one's conduct during life.",0
"The concept of the afterlife varies significantly among different religions and belief systems. Here is a brief overview of the afterlife beliefs in some of the world's major religions:

Christianity:

Heaven and Hell: In Christianity, the afterlife is characterized by the belief in heaven and hell. Heaven is a place of eternal happiness and communion with God for those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their savior, while hell is a realm of eternal separation from God for those who have rejected Him or lived in a state of sin. There are variations in beliefs about heaven and hell among different Christian denominations.
Islam:

Paradise (Jannah) and Hell (Jahannam): In Islam, the afterlife includes the concepts of paradise (Jannah) and hell (Jahannam). Muslims believe in the resurrection of the dead and the Day of Judgment. Righteous individuals are rewarded with eternal bliss in paradise, while the wicked are punished in hell. The degree of reward or punishment is based on one's deeds.
Judaism:

Sheol and Olam Ha-Ba: In Judaism, the concept of the afterlife has evolved over time. Early Jewish beliefs centered on Sheol, a shadowy underworld for the deceased. Modern Judaism is divided in its views on the afterlife, with some adherents believing in Olam Ha-Ba (the World to Come), where the righteous are rewarded, and others maintaining agnostic or metaphorical interpretations.
Hinduism:

Reincarnation and Moksha: Hinduism teaches the belief in reincarnation, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara). The ultimate goal is to break free from this cycle and attain moksha, which is liberation from the cycle of rebirth and union with the divine. Good and bad deeds (karma) in one's previous lives influence their future incarnations.
Buddhism:

Rebirth and Nirvana: Buddhism shares the concept of samsara (the cycle of birth and rebirth) with Hinduism. Buddhists seek to escape this cycle by attaining nirvana, a state of liberation from suffering and desire. The cycle of rebirth is driven by karma, and one's actions can influence their future lives.
Sikhism:

Cycle of Birth and Death and Union with God: Sikhs believe in the cycle of birth and death and aspire to achieve union with God. Reincarnation is a core belief, and Sikhs aim to live virtuous lives to ultimately merge with the divine (mukti or moksha).
Taoism:

Eternal Tao: In Taoism, the belief in an afterlife is not prominent. Instead, there is a focus on living in harmony with the Tao (the Way), which is the ultimate reality. It is less concerned with the afterlife and more with the present state of being.
Ancient Egyptian Religion:

Aaru and Duat: In ancient Egyptian religion, the afterlife was characterized by the belief in the soul's journey through the underworld (Duat) to reach the Field of Reeds (Aaru), a paradise for the blessed dead. The soul's journey was guided by rituals and spells, and it was believed that one's heart was weighed against a feather of truth in the judgment by Osiris.
These are just a few examples, and there are numerous other religious and spiritual traditions with their own beliefs about the afterlife. Beliefs about what happens after death are often central to a religion's worldview and have a profound influence on the moral and ethical behavior of its followers.

"The concept of the afterlife varies across different religions. Here is a brief overview of the afterlife in some major religions:

Christianity: Christians believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ and that those who believe in him will have eternal life in heaven. Those who do not believe in him will be condemned to hell 1.

Islam: Muslims believe in the Day of Judgment, where Allah will judge all people based on their deeds. Those who have done good deeds will go to paradise, while those who have done bad deeds will go to hell 1.

Hinduism: Hindus believe in reincarnation, where the soul is reborn into a new body after death. The cycle of reincarnation continues until the soul achieves moksha, or liberation from the cycle of rebirth 1.

Buddhism: Buddhists believe in reincarnation, where the soul is reborn into a new body after death. The goal is to achieve enlightenment and end the cycle of rebirth 1.

Judaism: Jews believe in an afterlife, but there are diverse views on the nature and destination of the soul. Some believe in resurrection, while others believe in an eternal spiritual existence 1.",0

The concept of the afterlife varies widely among different religions. Some religions believe in a heaven and hell, while others believe in reincarnation or a state of nothingness after death.

Here is a brief overview of the concept of the afterlife in some of the major world religions:

Christianity: Christians believe in heaven and hell. Heaven is a place of eternal happiness with God, while hell is a place of eternal suffering for those who have rejected God. Christians believe that people are judged after death based on their actions in life, and that those who are judged worthy will go to heaven, while those who are judged unworthy will go to hell.

Islam: Muslims believe in heaven and hell. Heaven is a place of eternal bliss with Allah, while hell is a place of eternal punishment for those who have disobeyed Allah. Muslims believe that people are judged after death based on their faith and their deeds, and that those who are judged righteous will go to heaven, while those who are judged wicked will go to hell.

Hinduism: Hindus believe in reincarnation. They believe that after death, the soul is reborn into a new body, either human or animal. The cycle of reincarnation continues until the soul achieves moksha, which is a state of liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

Buddhism: Buddhists believe in nirvana. Nirvana is a state of perfect peace and enlightenment. Buddhists believe that nirvana is achieved through the practice of the Eightfold Path.

Judaism: Jews believe in the resurrection of the dead. They believe that at the end of days, the dead will be resurrected and judged by God. Those who are judged righteous will live in the World to Come, a place of eternal bliss.

These are just a few examples of the concept of the afterlife in different religions. The afterlife is a complex and fascinating topic, and there is no one definitive answer to the question of what happens after we die.

"The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy recognizes multiple senses of the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“atheismÃ¢â‚¬Â, but is clear about which is standard in philosophy: [Atheism is] the view that there are no gods. A widely used sense denotes merely not believing in god and is consistent with agnosticism [in the psychological sense].",0
"Atheism is not a single, unified philosophy but rather a lack of belief in deities or gods. It is a position that asserts the absence of belief in the existence of God or gods. While atheism itself does not entail a specific philosophical system, atheists may hold a wide range of philosophical views and ethical principles. Here are some key aspects and principles associated with atheism:

Lack of Belief in God: At its core, atheism is characterized by the absence of belief in the existence of God or gods. Atheists do not accept the claims of theism (belief in God) and typically require evidence or reasons to believe in the divine.

Secularism: Many atheists support secularism, which advocates for a clear separation between religious institutions and government. They argue that religious beliefs and practices should not influence public policy or law, ensuring that individuals of all belief systems or non-belief are treated equally.

Empiricism and Skepticism: Atheists often emphasize the importance of empiricism and skepticism. They may value scientific methods, critical thinking, and evidence-based reasoning as the most reliable means of understanding the natural world and making informed judgments about reality.

Naturalism: Naturalism is a philosophical position commonly embraced by atheists. It posits that the natural world is all that exists and that there is no supernatural realm or entities. Everything can be explained by natural laws and processes.

Morality and Ethics: Atheists derive their moral and ethical principles from a variety of sources, such as secular humanism, rationalism, and moral philosophy. They may emphasize the importance of human well-being, empathy, and ethical principles based on reason and social cooperation.

Humanism: Secular humanism is a philosophy that focuses on human values, potential, and well-being without relying on religious beliefs. Many atheists align with humanism, emphasizing the importance of reason, compassion, and human responsibility.

Critical Examination of Religion: Atheism often involves a critical examination of religious beliefs and practices. Atheists may engage in discussions and debates about the existence of God and the rationality of religious claims.

Diversity of Views: It's important to recognize that atheism is not a monolithic philosophy. Within the atheist community, there are various perspectives and philosophies, ranging from agnostic atheists who are uncertain about the existence of God to strong atheists who assert that no gods exist.

Agnosticism: While atheism involves the absence of belief in gods, agnosticism is a related concept. Agnostics claim that the existence of gods is unknown or unknowable. Some individuals identify as both agnostic and atheist.

Existentialism: Some atheists are drawn to existentialist philosophy, which explores the meaning and purpose of life in the absence of religious or divine guidance. Existentialists may emphasize individual freedom and responsibility in creating one's own meaning.

It's important to note that atheism does not dictate a comprehensive worldview or set of beliefs beyond the absence of belief in deities. Individuals who identify as atheists can have diverse philosophical, ethical, and moral perspectives, and their worldviews can be shaped by various influences, including culture, personal experiences, and philosophical interests.

"The philosophy of atheism is the belief that there is no God or spiritual beings and that humanity must rely only on itself to improve human life and solve the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s problems. Atheism is a rejection of religious beliefs and is often distinguished from theism, which affirms the reality of the divine and often seeks to demonstrate its existence. Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include the lack of evidence, the problem of evil, the argument from inconsistent revelations, the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified, and the argument from nonbelief 1.

In summary, atheism is a philosophical movement that rejects religious beliefs and affirms that there is no God or spiritual beings. Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches.",0

Atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of God or gods. Atheists do not believe in any supernatural beings or forces.

There are many different reasons why people become atheists. Some atheists are simply not convinced by the evidence for the existence of God. Others have experienced religious trauma or abuse, which has led them to reject religion altogether. Still others simply do not see the need for God in their lives.

Atheism is not a monolithic philosophy. There is a wide range of views among atheists on a variety of topics, such as the meaning of life, the nature of reality, and the ethics of morality. However, all atheists share the common belief that there is no God or gods.

Here are some of the key philosophical tenets of atheism:

Skepticism: Atheists are skeptical of claims about the supernatural. They demand evidence before they will believe anything, including claims about the existence of God.
Rationality: Atheists believe that reason is the best way to understand the world. They reject appeals to faith or emotion as a basis for belief.
Empiricism: Atheists believe that the best way to acquire knowledge is through experience. They reject claims about the supernatural that cannot be verified through observation or experimentation.
Humanism: Atheists believe that humans are capable of living good and meaningful lives without the need for God. They emphasize the importance of human reason, compassion, and cooperation.
Atheism is a growing movement around the world. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, about 26% of adults worldwide identify as atheist or agnostic. Atheism is particularly prevalent in developed countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Western Europe.

Atheism is a valid and important philosophical position. Atheists make important contributions to society in all walks of life. They are scientists, artists, writers, activists, and more. Atheists are just as diverse as any other population group, and they should be respected for their beliefs.

"The modern concept of religious tolerance developed out of the European wars of religion, more specifically out of the Peace of Westphalia which ended the 30 Years' War (1618Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1648), during the Protestant Reformation and the ensuing conflicts between Protestants and Catholics in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.",0
"The history of religious tolerance and intolerance is a complex and multifaceted one, shaped by a wide range of historical, cultural, and political factors. Here is an overview of the historical developments in the attitudes toward religious diversity:

Ancient Civilizations:

In some ancient civilizations, religious tolerance was practiced. For example, the Achaemenid Empire of Persia under Cyrus the Great allowed conquered peoples to retain their religious practices.
Ancient India, with its diverse array of religions, often practiced religious tolerance and coexistence. Emperor Ashoka, in particular, promoted religious tolerance during his reign.
Roman Empire:

The Roman Empire was initially religiously tolerant, allowing the practice of various religions within its territories. However, this changed as Christianity gained power, leading to periods of persecution and intolerance against non-Christian religions, especially during the reign of Emperor Constantine.
Medieval Europe:

The Middle Ages in Europe saw periods of religious conflict and intolerance, including the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition. The Catholic Church played a dominant role in promoting its own religious orthodoxy and suppressing dissenting views.
Enlightenment and Early Modern Period:

The Enlightenment in Europe saw the rise of ideas promoting religious tolerance and individual freedom of conscience. Thinkers like John Locke argued for the separation of church and state and the protection of religious diversity.
Colonial America:

The United States, with its diverse religious landscape, enshrined religious freedom in its Constitution's First Amendment. The principle of religious tolerance was foundational in the development of the nation.
Modern Era:

The 20th century witnessed both improvements in religious tolerance and periods of religious conflict and intolerance. The Holocaust and other instances of religious persecution during World War II were among the most significant examples of religious intolerance.
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 enshrined the right to freedom of religion and belief.
Contemporary Times:

Religious tolerance and intolerance remain complex issues in the modern world. Many nations have laws and policies promoting religious freedom, while others still experience religious discrimination and violence.
Interfaith dialogues and efforts to promote religious tolerance continue at various levels, seeking to foster understanding and peaceful coexistence among diverse religious communities.
The history of religious tolerance and intolerance is marked by a dynamic interplay of religious, political, and cultural forces. While progress has been made in many parts of the world toward greater religious freedom and respect for diverse beliefs, challenges and conflicts persist. Efforts to promote religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue remain vital for the peaceful coexistence of religiously diverse societies.",0
"Throughout history, societies across the world have varied between religious tolerance and intolerance. The Roman Empire promoted polytheistic faiths and campaigned violently against Christianity, which was growing as a major faith. However, in 311 CE, Emperor Galerius issued an edict of toleration for Christianity, ceasing the persecution of followers of that religion. In 313, co-emperors Licinius and Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which again promulgated the toleration of Christians (which had returned after the 311 edict). This edict also emphasized that all religions would be tolerated in the Roman Empire. While the Roman Empire thereafter embraced Christianity, it quickly began to persecute the polytheistic faiths of the empire, despite the Edict of Milan. While the Roman Empire tolerated Christianity, it did not tolerate other religions. There was also much intolerance between the rival branches of Christianity, which sparked into massacres. This continued to be the case after the collapse of the Roman Empire. The Jewish population of Europe was targeted throughout the Medieval Period in numerous pogroms, or massacres. Christian Crusaders murdered thousands of non-Christians in the sack of Jerusalem. In 1096 CE, the Christian kingdoms of Europe launched the Crusades, a series of military campaigns chiefly targeting the Muslim states of Jerusalem and surrounding areas. As part of the Crusades, Christian Crusaders murdered thousands in sacked cities. The Crusades also targeted other Christian sects across Europe and polytheistic peoples in northern Europe 1.

In modern times, religious tolerance has become more widespread and is often enshrined in law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right 1. However, religious intolerance still exists in many parts of the world and can lead to discrimination, persecution, and violence 1.

In summary, throughout history societies across the world have varied between religious tolerance and intolerance. While religious tolerance has become more widespread in modern times and is often enshrined in law, religious intolerance still exists in many parts of the world and can lead to discrimination, persecution, and violence.",0
"
The history of religious tolerance and intolerance is a complex one, dating back to the early days of organized religion.

In ancient times, most cultures were polytheistic, meaning that they believed in many gods. This led to a relatively high degree of religious tolerance, as different cultures were willing to accept the gods of other cultures.

However, with the rise of monotheistic religions such as Christianity and Islam, the situation became more complex. Monotheistic religions believe in only one God, and they often see other religions as false or even evil. This led to a period of religious intolerance and persecution, as monotheistic religions sought to suppress other religions.

The Middle Ages were a particularly intolerant time for religious minorities. In Europe, the Catholic Church was the dominant religion, and it persecuted Jews, Muslims, and other non-Christians. In the Islamic world, Muslims persecuted Jews, Christians, and other non-Muslims.

The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century led to a new period of religious intolerance in Europe. As different Protestant groups emerged, they often fought each other for religious dominance. This led to wars such as the Thirty Years' War, which devastated Europe.

The Enlightenment in the 18th century brought a new appreciation for religious tolerance. Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire and John Locke argued that people should be free to practice their religion without fear of persecution.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, religious tolerance became more widespread. This was due in part to the rise of secularism, which is the belief that religion should be separate from government and society. It was also due to the influence of human rights movements, which fought for the rights of all people, regardless of their religion.

However, religious intolerance persists in many parts of the world today. In some countries, governments persecute religious minorities. In other countries, religious extremists carry out attacks on people of other faiths.

Despite these challenges, there is also a growing movement for religious tolerance and pluralism. This movement is based on the belief that people of all faiths can live together in peace and harmony.

Here are some specific examples of religious tolerance and intolerance throughout history:

Religious tolerance:

In ancient India, the Hindu emperor Ashoka the Great promoted religious tolerance and pluralism. He built temples and monasteries for all religions, and he encouraged his subjects to live in harmony with each other.
In the 17th century, the Dutch Republic was a haven for religious refugees from all over Europe. The Dutch government granted religious freedom to all citizens, regardless of their faith.
In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion. This means that the government cannot favor one religion over another, and it cannot interfere with people's right to practice their religion.
Religious intolerance:

In the 13th century, the Catholic Church established the Inquisition to suppress heresy. The Inquisition tortured and executed thousands of people who were accused of heresy, including Jews, Muslims, and Christians who did not adhere to the Catholic Church's teachings.
In the 16th century, the Spanish Inquisition was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Jews, Muslims, and Protestants.
In the 20th century, the Nazi regime in Germany persecuted Jews, Christians, and other religious minorities. The Nazis killed millions of people in the Holocaust.
These are just a few examples of the history of religious tolerance and intolerance. Religious tolerance is an important value, but it is also a fragile one. It is important to be vigilant in defending religious freedom and to promote interfaith dialogue and understanding.",0

"The Big Bang theory is the prevailing scientific explanation for the origin of the universe. It proposes that the universe began as a singularity, an infinitely hot and dense point, approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This singularity then underwent a rapid expansion, leading to the formation of the universe as we know it today. Here are the key components of the Big Bang theory:

Initial Singularity: The theory posits that the universe was initially compressed into an incredibly hot and dense state, often referred to as a singularity. At this point, the laws of physics as we know them break down, making it challenging to describe the conditions of the universe.

Cosmic Expansion: Around 13.8 billion years ago, the universe began expanding rapidly from this initial singularity. This expansion continues to this day. The evidence for this expansion includes the redshift of light from distant galaxies, as observed by astronomers like Edwin Hubble.

Formation of Matter and Atoms: As the universe expanded and cooled, subatomic particles formed and began to combine into atoms, primarily hydrogen and helium. These early atoms were the building blocks of matter.

Formation of Galaxies and Stars: As the universe continued to expand, regions of higher density formed, and gravitational forces caused these regions to collapse, leading to the formation of galaxies and stars. These celestial bodies played a vital role in the evolution of the universe.

Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation: One of the key pieces of evidence supporting the Big Bang theory is the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). This is a faint, uniform glow of microwave radiation that permeates the universe. It is considered the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides insights into the early universe's conditions.

Expanding Universe Confirmation: Observations of distant galaxies' redshifts and the discovery of the CMB provided strong support for the Big Bang theory. These observations align with the theory's predictions about the expansion and cooling of the universe.

Development of Structure: Over billions of years, the universe evolved, with matter clumping together to form galaxies, stars, and planets. The theory explains the large-scale structure of the universe, including the distribution of galaxies and cosmic filaments.

The Big Bang theory has become the foundation of modern cosmology and has been supported by a wealth of empirical evidence. It provides a framework for understanding the origin and development of the universe, from its initial, unimaginably hot and dense state to its current state of expansion and complexity. While the theory has been extremely successful in explaining many aspects of the cosmos, there are still ongoing questions and areas of exploration in the field of cosmology.

The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model for the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model accounts for the fact that the universe expanded from an initial state of extremely high density and high temperature, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large-scale structure, and Hubble's law.

Big Bang theory

History of the Big Bang theory

The Big Bang theory was first proposed in the 1920s by Georges LemaÃƒÂ®tre, a Belgian Catholic priest and physicist. LemaÃƒÂ®tre's theory was based on the observation that the galaxies were moving away from each other, which suggested that the universe was expanding.

In the 1930s, Edwin Hubble, an American astronomer, confirmed that the universe was expanding. Hubble also discovered that the rate of expansion of the universe was accelerating.

In the 1940s, George Gamow, a Russian-American physicist, developed a theory about the early universe that predicted the existence of the CMB. The CMB was discovered in 1965, which provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory.

Evidence for the Big Bang theory

There is a lot of evidence to support the Big Bang theory, including:

The abundance of light elements, such as hydrogen and helium, in the universe. The Big Bang theory predicts that the early universe was very hot and dense, which would have caused the formation of light elements.
The CMB, which is a faint glow of light that is present throughout the universe. The CMB is thought to be the remnant radiation from the Big Bang.
Large-scale structure, such as the distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The Big Bang theory predicts that large-scale structure would have formed over time due to the gravitational pull of matter.
Hubble's law, which states that the galaxies are moving away from each other at a rate that is proportional to their distance. This is consistent with the idea that the universe is expanding.
Conclusion

The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted theory for the origin and evolution of the universe. It is supported by a wide range of evidence, including the abundance of light elements, the CMB, large-scale structure, and Hubble's law.

The Big Bang theory is not without its challenges, but it remains the best explanation for the observable universe.",0
"The Parallax Angle -- How Astronomers Use Angular Measurement to Compute Distances in Space. The parallax angle is the angle between the Earth at one time of year, and the Earth six months later, as measured from a nearby star. Astronomers use this angle to find the distance from the Earth to that star.",0
"Astronomers use several methods to measure the distances to stars, depending on the star's location, properties, and other factors. Here are some of the most commonly used methods:

Parallax Method: This is the most fundamental method for measuring the distance to nearby stars. It relies on the apparent shift in a star's position as the Earth orbits the Sun. When observing a nearby star from different positions in Earth's orbit (roughly six months apart), astronomers can measure the change in its apparent position against more distant background stars. The degree of angular shift is used to calculate the star's distance.

Spectroscopic Parallax: This method is an extension of the parallax method and is applicable to more distant stars. Astronomers use a star's apparent brightness and spectral characteristics to estimate its luminosity. By comparing its luminosity with its apparent brightness, they can deduce the star's distance.

Cepheid Variables: Cepheid variable stars are a type of pulsating star with a period of variability that is closely related to their intrinsic luminosity. By measuring the star's apparent brightness and its period of variation, astronomers can determine its absolute luminosity. This, in turn, allows them to calculate its distance.

RR Lyrae Stars: Similar to Cepheid variables, RR Lyrae stars are pulsating stars with a well-defined relationship between their period of variation and luminosity. They are used to measure distances to globular clusters and other regions of the Milky Way.

Main Sequence Fitting: By comparing a star's color (spectral type) and brightness to theoretical models of stellar evolution, astronomers can determine its luminosity. With the apparent brightness and known luminosity, they can compute the star's distance.

Luminosity-Radius Method: For stars in binary systems, where one star eclipses the other, astronomers can measure the eclipses' characteristics to determine the stars' radii and, by extension, their luminosities. This method helps calculate the distance to the binary system.

Binary Star Systems: In cases where one star in a binary system is too distant to measure its parallax, the distance can be estimated based on the motion of the two stars around their common center of mass. This method provides information about the stars' orbits and their relative masses.

Standard Candles: Certain types of supernovae, like Type Ia supernovae, have nearly constant luminosities. By measuring their apparent brightness, astronomers can estimate their distances. These supernovae are used to measure the distance to galaxies and determine the rate of the universe's expansion.

Hipparcos Satellite Data: The European Space Agency's Hipparcos satellite provided highly accurate parallax measurements for a large number of stars. This data has been invaluable for determining stellar distances.

Astrometry with Gaia: The Gaia satellite, launched by the European Space Agency, is providing extremely precise measurements of stellar positions and parallaxes. It is expected to significantly improve our knowledge of stellar distances.

These methods, either individually or in combination, allow astronomers to determine the distances to a wide range of stars, from those in our immediate galactic neighborhood to those in distant galaxies. Accurate distance measurements are fundamental for understanding the properties, dynamics, and evolution of celestial objects.",0
"Astronomers use a variety of methods to measure the distance to stars, but the most common method is the parallax method. This method involves observing a star from two different positions in space, six months apart, and measuring the angle between the two observations. The distance to the star can then be calculated using trigonometry 1.

For more distant stars, astronomers use other methods based on estimating their intrinsic brightness. One such method is spectroscopic parallax, which uses the starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spectrum to determine its luminosity, which measures the total energy it emits. To determine its distance, astronomers then compare this luminosity to the starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apparent brightness, as seen from Earth 2.

In summary, astronomers use a variety of methods to measure the distance to stars, but the most common method is the parallax method. For more distant stars, astronomers use other methods based on estimating their intrinsic brightness.",0
"Astronomers use a variety of methods to measure the distance to stars, depending on the distance of the star.

Parallax

The most direct method of measuring the distance to stars is parallax. Parallax is the apparent displacement of an object due to a change in the observer's point of view. Astronomers measure the parallax of a star by observing it from two different locations, such as Earth and six months later when Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. The parallax angle is the angle between the two lines of sight to the star. By knowing the distance between the two observation points and the parallax angle, astronomers can calculate the distance to the star.

Standard candles

Standard candles are objects whose brightness is known. Astronomers can compare the brightness of a standard candle to the brightness of a star to determine the star's distance. For example, Cepheid variable stars are a type of standard candle that pulsate in brightness at a regular rate. By measuring the period of a Cepheid variable star, astronomers can determine its brightness. By comparing the brightness of a Cepheid variable star to the brightness of a star, astronomers can calculate the star's distance.

Spectroscopic parallax

Spectroscopic parallax is a method of measuring the distance to stars by analyzing their spectra. The spectrum of a star is a rainbow of colors that is produced by the different wavelengths of light that the star emits. The brightness of the different wavelengths of light in a star's spectrum can be used to determine the star's distance.

Redshift

Redshift is the stretching of light waves due to the expansion of the universe. The more distant a star is, the greater its redshift. By measuring the redshift of a star, astronomers can calculate its distance.

Other methods

Other methods that astronomers use to measure the distance to stars include:

Moving cluster parallax: This method uses the motion of stars in a moving cluster to determine the distance to the cluster.
Tully-Fisher relation: This method uses the relationship between the brightness and the rotation rate of spiral galaxies to determine the distance to the galaxies.
Direct distance measurements: This method can be used to measure the distance to stars that are very close to Earth. Astronomers can use radar or laser light to measure the distance to these stars.
The method that astronomers use to measure the distance to a star depends on the star's distance and other factors, such as the type of star and the availability of data.

Here is a table summarizing the different methods of measuring the distance to stars:

| Method | Distance range |
|---|---|---|
| Parallax | Within 100 light-years |
| Standard candles | Up to 100 million light-years |
| Spectroscopic parallax | Up to 1 billion light-years |
| Redshift | Beyond 1 billion light-years |
| Moving cluster parallax | Up to 100 million light-years |
| Tully-Fisher relation | Up to 1 billion light-years |
| Direct distance measurements | Within 100 light-years |",0
A black hole is a region in space where the pulling force of gravity is so strong that light is not able to escape. The strong gravity occurs because matter has been pressed into a tiny space. This compression can take place at the end of a star's life. Some black holes are a result of dying stars.,0
"A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. Black holes are formed through the gravitational collapse of massive objects, typically the remnants of massive stars. The formation of a black hole goes through several stages:

Stellar Evolution: A black hole typically forms from the remnants of a massive star, one many times more massive than our Sun. During its normal life cycle, such a star fuses hydrogen into helium and then successively heavier elements in its core. When the core runs out of nuclear fuel, the star undergoes a series of phases, eventually leading to its collapse.

Supernova Explosion: As the massive star nears the end of its life, the energy generated by nuclear fusion can no longer counteract the force of gravity pulling the star inward. When the core contracts to a critical point, it triggers a catastrophic event called a supernova explosion. The outer layers of the star are expelled into space in a violent explosion, while the core contracts further.

Formation of a Neutron Star or Black Hole: The outcome depends on the mass of the core. If the core's mass is less than about 2.18 times the mass of the Sun (the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), it may collapse further and become a neutron star, a dense, city-sized remnant made primarily of neutrons. If the core's mass exceeds this limit, the gravitational collapse continues, and a black hole forms.

Event Horizon: In a black hole, the core collapses to a point of infinite density known as a singularity, surrounded by an invisible boundary called the event horizon. The event horizon is the point of no return; once an object crosses this boundary, it can never escape the gravitational pull of the black hole.

Three Key Properties: Black holes are characterized by three key properties:

Mass: The mass of a black hole is concentrated at its singularity.
Singularity: The singularity is a point of infinite density, where the laws of physics, as we understand them, break down.
Event Horizon: The event horizon is the region around the black hole beyond which nothing can escape, not even light.
There are different types of black holes:

Stellar-Mass Black Holes: These black holes have masses ranging from a few to several tens of times that of the Sun. They are formed from the remnants of massive stars.
Intermediate-Mass Black Holes: These have masses between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes and are less common.
Supermassive Black Holes: Supermassive black holes have millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun and are typically found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way.
Black holes are not directly observable because they do not emit or reflect light. Instead, astronomers detect them by observing their gravitational effects on nearby matter, such as the way they interact with other stars or by studying the radiation emitted by matter as it is pulled into the black hole, creating what is known as an accretion disk. Black holes are a fascinating area of study in astrophysics and have contributed significantly to our understanding of the nature of space and time.

A black hole is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape it. Black holes are formed when massive stars die and their cores collapse under the force of gravity, creating a singularity, a point of zero volume and infinite density 1.

The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of stellar mass black holes. Star formation in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars, which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to 10^3 solar masses 2.

Black holes are invisible to the naked eye, but their presence can be detected by observing their effects on nearby matter. For example, if a black hole is in a binary system with another star, it can cause the star to orbit around it in an unusual way 3.

In summary, a black hole is a region of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape it. It is formed when massive stars die and their cores collapse under the force of gravity. Black holes are invisible to the naked eye but can be detected by observing their effects on nearby matter.",0

A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to create a black hole.

Black holes are formed when massive stars collapse at the end of their lives. When a star runs out of fuel, it can no longer support its own weight and collapses under its own gravity. If the star is massive enough, it will collapse into a black hole.

Black holes are invisible, but their presence can be inferred from their effects on their surroundings. For example, a black hole can orbit another star and pull material from the star's atmosphere. This creates a disk of hot gas around the black hole, which emits X-rays.

Black holes are some of the most mysterious objects in the universe. Scientists are still learning about how they form and behave.

Here is a summary of the steps involved in the formation of a black hole:

A massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity.
The star's core collapses into a neutron star.
If the star is massive enough, the neutron star will continue to collapse and form a black hole.
The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. The size of the event horizon depends on the mass of the black hole. The more massive the black hole, the larger the event horizon.

Black holes play an important role in the evolution of galaxies. They are thought to be responsible for the formation of supermassive black holes, which are found at the centers of most galaxies.

Black holes are also thought to be responsible for the ejection of jets of material from galaxy nuclei. These jets can heat up the surrounding gas and prevent star formation.

Black holes are fascinating and mysterious objects. Scientists are still learning about how they form and behave.",0
"This 'family portrait' shows a composite of images of Jupiter, including it's Great Red Spot, and its four largest moons. From top to bottom, the moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.",0
"Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has a remarkable collection of moons, with over 80 confirmed natural satellites. Four of these moons are known as the Galilean moons because they were discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610. These four largest moons of Jupiter are among the most significant and well-known in the solar system. Here are the Galilean moons and some other notable moons of Jupiter:

Io: Io is the innermost of the Galilean moons and the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Its surface is marked by numerous active volcanoes, and it is known for its colorful sulfur-rich landscape.

Europa: Europa is the second Galilean moon and is believed to have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy crust. This moon is considered one of the most promising places in the solar system to search for extraterrestrial life.

Ganymede: Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even larger than the planet Mercury. It has a complex geology and a magnetic field. Ganymede may also have a subsurface ocean beneath its icy shell.

Callisto: Callisto is the outermost of the Galilean moons and is known for its heavily cratered surface. It is one of the most heavily cratered bodies in the solar system, suggesting it has undergone minimal geological activity.

Amalthea: Amalthea is one of Jupiter's innermost moons and is irregularly shaped. It was discovered in 1892 and is much smaller than the Galilean moons.

Himalia: Himalia is one of the larger irregular-shaped moons of Jupiter. It was discovered in 1904.

Thebe: Thebe is a small, irregularly shaped moon of Jupiter and is one of the innermost satellites of the planet.

Elara: Elara is one of Jupiter's irregularly shaped outer moons and was discovered in 1905.

Metis: Metis is a small inner moon of Jupiter, and it was discovered in 1979.

Adrastea: Adrastea is another of Jupiter's small inner moons, and it was discovered in 1979.

These are just a few of the many moons of Jupiter. The largest and most significant ones are the Galilean moons, which played a crucial role in our understanding of the nature of celestial bodies in the solar system. Jupiter's extensive moon system continues to be a subject of scientific study and exploration, with missions like the Juno spacecraft providing valuable data on the planet and its moons.

"Jupiter has a total of 95 moons with confirmed orbits as of March 23, 2023 1. The four largest moons of Jupiter are known as the Galilean moons, named after their discoverer, Galileo Galilei. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto 1. These four moons are the largest objects in the Jovian system and are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass. The remaining 91 known moons and the rings together compose just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass 1.

JupiterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moons have a wide range of physical and orbital characteristics. The four Galilean moons are over 3,100 kilometers (1,900 miles) in diameter, with Ganymede being larger than Mercury and the ninth largest object in the Solar System 1. All other Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometers (160 miles) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) 1. Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to JupiterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rotation (retrograde motion) 1.",0

"The eight lunar phases are, in order: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, third quarter and waning crescent.",0
"The phases of the moon are the different shapes and appearances of the moon as seen from Earth. These phases result from the changing relative positions of the moon, Earth, and the Sun as the moon orbits our planet. There are eight primary phases of the moon, which can be described as follows:

New Moon: The moon is located between the Earth and the Sun, with the side of the moon illuminated by the Sun facing away from Earth. It appears as a dark circle and is not visible from Earth.

Waxing Crescent: A small, crescent-shaped sliver of the moon becomes visible shortly after the new moon. It is illuminated on the right side when seen from the Northern Hemisphere and on the left side when seen from the Southern Hemisphere.

First Quarter: In this phase, half of the moon's disk is illuminated and visible from Earth. It is called the ""first quarter"" because it marks the first quarter of the moon's orbit around Earth.

Waxing Gibbous: More than half of the moon's disk is illuminated, but it is not yet full. The waxing gibbous moon is visibly larger and more illuminated than the first quarter.

Full Moon: The moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, and its entire disk is illuminated when viewed from Earth. Full moons are bright and round.

Waning Gibbous: The moon begins to decrease in illumination after the full moon. It is still more than half illuminated, but it appears to be shrinking in size.

Last Quarter: In this phase, half of the moon's disk is illuminated, but it is the left half when viewed from the Northern Hemisphere and the right half when viewed from the Southern Hemisphere.

Waning Crescent: The moon is now a thin crescent shape, with only a small portion of its disk illuminated. It is nearing the new moon phase, and the illuminated part is on the left side when seen from the Northern Hemisphere and the right side when seen from the Southern Hemisphere.

These eight primary phases represent the moon's changing appearance as it orbits Earth. In addition to these phases, there are intermediate phases, such as the ""waxing crescent"" and ""waning crescent,"" that describe the moon's appearance between the major phases. The moon completes one orbit around Earth approximately every 29.5 days, leading to a full cycle of lunar phases.

Full Moon: The entire side of the Moon facing Earth is illuminated by the Sun, and it appears as a full circle.
Third Quarter: Half of the Moon is visible from Earth, and it appears as a half-circle.
The intermediate phases are:

Waxing Crescent: The Moon is partially illuminated, and it appears as a crescent shape.
Waxing Gibbous: The Moon is more than half illuminated, and it appears as a bulging crescent shape.
Waning Gibbous: The Moon is more than half illuminated, and it appears as a shrinking bulging crescent shape.

"he Hubble Deep Field Ã¢â‚¬â€ revealed galaxies fainter than had ever been seen before. The light from some of these has traveled for 10 billion years to reach us. It showed us a sliver of the early universe, from long before our sun was born. This is really a three-dimensional picture, a cosmic core sample.",0
"The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is a series of groundbreaking images captured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) over several deep fields in space. The primary objective of the Hubble Deep Field observations was to capture detailed, high-resolution images of distant galaxies and other celestial objects, allowing astronomers to study the early universe, the evolution of galaxies, and the distribution of matter in space. The most well-known and iconic of these images is the Hubble Deep Field, but there have been subsequent versions, including the Hubble Deep Field South and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.

The Hubble Deep Field observations were conducted as follows:

Hubble Deep Field (HDF): The first Hubble Deep Field was captured in 1995. It focused on a relatively tiny and apparently empty area of the sky in the constellation Ursa Major. This seemingly empty region was chosen precisely because it contained very few stars and objects from our own Milky Way galaxy. Over the course of ten consecutive days, Hubble observed the same patch of sky, accumulating light from distant galaxies and objects. The resulting image revealed thousands of galaxies, some of which are over 12 billion light-years away, providing a glimpse into the early universe.

Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S): The success of the original HDF led to the creation of the Hubble Deep Field South in 1998. This image focused on a region of the southern sky in the constellation Tucana. The HDF-S revealed an equally rich and diverse population of galaxies.

Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF): The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, observed in 2003 and subsequently in 2004 and 2012 (Hubble Ultra Deep Field Infrared, or HUDF-IR), is an extension of the original HDF. It combined observations of a small area of the sky, exposing it for a total of over a million seconds. This image delved even deeper into the universe, capturing galaxies that are farther and therefore older than those in the original HDF.

These deep field images have been transformative in our understanding of the universe. They revealed the sheer number and diversity of galaxies in the early universe, provided insights into galaxy formation and evolution, and offered valuable data for cosmological studies. They have also contributed to our understanding of the distribution of dark matter in the universe, among other important scientific discoveries. The Hubble Deep Field series remains a symbol of the Hubble Space Telescope's capabilities and its ability to unveil the wonders of the cosmos.",0
"The Hubble Deep Field is an image of a small region in the constellation Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. It covers an area about 2.6 arcminutes on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100 meters 1. The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space TelescopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 over ten consecutive days between December 18 and 28, 1995 1. The field is so small that only a few foreground stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known 1. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the study of the early universe 1. Three years after the HDF observations were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged in a similar way and named the Hubble Deep Field South 1. The similarities between the two regions strengthened the belief that the universe is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the cosmological principle) 1. A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In 2004, a deeper image, known as the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive astronomical image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) was released in 2012 1.

In summary, The Hubble Deep Field is an image of a small region in Ursa Major constellation constructed from a series of observations by Hubble Space Telescope. It covers an area about 2.6 arcminutes on a side, which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100 meters. Almost all of the objects in this image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known.

"What is dark matter? We are much more certain what dark matter is not than we are what it is. First, it is dark, meaning that it is not in the form of stars and planets that we see. Observations show that there is far too little visible matter in the universe to make up the 27% required by the observations.",0
"Dark matter is a mysterious and as-yet-undetected form of matter that makes up a significant portion of the mass in the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, so it is invisible and transparent, which is why it's called ""dark."" The concept of dark matter was proposed to explain several puzzling phenomena in the cosmos:

Galactic Rotation Curves: When astronomers observed the rotational speeds of stars within galaxies, they found that the outer stars were orbiting at nearly the same speed as the inner stars. This was unexpected because, according to the laws of gravity, the outer stars should be moving more slowly. The explanation for this phenomenon is the presence of unseen, massive dark matter halos around galaxies that provide additional gravitational pull, keeping the outer stars in motion.

Galactic Mass Discrepancy: When measuring the mass of galaxies based on the visible matter (stars, gas, dust, etc.), the mass appears insufficient to explain the gravitational effects observed. The missing mass, often referred to as ""missing mass"" or ""dark matter,"" is postulated to be present in the form of non-luminous matter that interacts gravitationally.

Cosmic Microwave Background: Observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the afterglow of the Big Bang, indicate that the universe contains dark matter. The distribution of matter and the fluctuations in the background radiation can be explained by the presence of dark matter.

Large-Scale Structure: The distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe, as observed in large-scale surveys, can be better explained by the gravitational influence of dark matter, which forms a cosmic web-like structure.

Dark matter remains a theoretical concept because it has not been directly observed. Scientists have not yet identified the exact nature of dark matter particles, and it remains one of the most significant unsolved mysteries in astrophysics and cosmology.

Various experiments and observations are ongoing to detect dark matter indirectly through its gravitational effects or directly through interactions with other particles. If and when dark matter is detected, it will provide a better understanding of the universe's composition and help solve many of the mysteries related to the cosmos' structure and evolution.

"Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that has gravity but does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, which means it is invisible and difficult to detect 1. It makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe and is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter 1. The nature of dark matter is still unknown and is one of the greatest challenges for astral scientists and researchers 1. The term Ã¢â‚¬Å“dark matterÃ¢â‚¬Â was first used by Swiss American astronomer Fritz Zwicky in 1933, who noticed that the mass of the stars in a cluster of galaxies was not enough to explain the clusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gravitational pull 1.

The existence of dark matter was first proposed in the 1930s, but it was not until the 1970s that its importance in the universe was fully recognized 2. Dark matter is thought to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and other large structures in the universe 2. Despite its importance, dark matter has never been directly observed, and its nature remains one of the greatest mysteries in modern astrophysics 2.

In summary, dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe. It has gravity but does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, which makes it invisible and difficult to detect. The nature of dark matter is still unknown and is one of the greatest challenges for astral scientists and researchers.

Dark matter is a mysterious substance that makes up about 85% of the matter in the universe. It is invisible to telescopes and cannot be directly detected, but its presence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter.

Dark matter is thought to be made up of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). WIMPs are hypothetical particles that are much heavier than protons and neutrons. They are also thought to interact with each other very weakly, which is why they are so difficult to detect.

Scientists are still trying to learn more about dark matter. They are conducting experiments to try to detect WIMPs directly. They are also studying the gravitational effects of dark matter on galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

Dark matter is a fascinating and important mystery. It plays a major role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Scientists are hopeful that they will be able to learn more about dark matter in the coming years.

Here are some of the evidence that suggests the existence of dark matter:

Galaxy rotation curves: The rotation curves of galaxies show that the galaxies have more mass than can be accounted for by the visible stars and gas. This suggests that there is a large amount of unseen matter, such as dark matter, that is contributing to the gravity of the galaxies.
Clusters of galaxies: Clusters of galaxies are held together by gravity. The amount of gravity required to hold together the clusters is much greater than the gravity that can be accounted for by the visible stars and gas in the clusters. This suggests that there is a large amount of unseen matter, such as dark matter, that is contributing to the gravity of the clusters.
Lensing: Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon where light from a distant object is bent by the gravity of a closer object. Dark matter can also cause gravitational lensing. Observations of gravitational lensing have provided strong evidence for the existence of dark matter.
Dark matter is a mysterious substance, but it is an important part of the universe. Scientists are still learning about dark matter, but they are making progress in understanding its nature and role in the cosmos.",0

"The history of vaccinations is a fascinating journey that spans centuries and has saved countless lives. Here is an overview of key milestones in the history of vaccinations:

Variolation (c. 1000 CE): The concept of immunization can be traced back to ancient China and India, where people practiced a method known as variolation. Smallpox scabs or material from pustules of smallpox patients were scratched into the skin of healthy individuals to induce a milder form of the disease, which often conferred immunity.

Edward Jenner and Smallpox (1796): Edward Jenner, an English physician, is often credited with the discovery of the smallpox vaccine. He noticed that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox, a less severe disease, seemed to be immune to smallpox. In 1796, he conducted an experiment by taking material from a cowpox sore and infecting a young boy. The boy became mildly ill with cowpox but did not contract smallpox. This experiment laid the foundation for the concept of vaccination, derived from the Latin word ""vacca,"" meaning cow.

Louis Pasteur and Germ Theory (19th Century): Louis Pasteur, a French chemist and microbiologist, made significant contributions to the understanding of infectious diseases. He developed vaccines for diseases like rabies and anthrax, based on his work on the germ theory of disease. These vaccines marked a new era in the development of preventive medicine.

Development of Other Vaccines (20th Century): The 20th century saw the development of numerous vaccines, including those for diseases like polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. These vaccines became an integral part of public health efforts, significantly reducing the prevalence of these diseases.

Eradication of Smallpox (1980): Through an extensive global vaccination campaign, smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. This marked one of the most significant achievements in the history of vaccination.

Expanded Immunization Programs: In the latter half of the 20th century, vaccination programs were expanded to target various infectious diseases, leading to a significant reduction in their prevalence and related mortality.

Development of Modern Vaccines: Advances in science and technology have enabled the development of vaccines for various infectious diseases, including hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza, and more. These vaccines have continued to improve public health by preventing the spread of these diseases.

COVID-19 Vaccines (21st Century): The COVID-19 pandemic in the early 21st century led to the rapid development of vaccines, including mRNA-based vaccines like those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. These vaccines were developed in record time and played a crucial role in the fight against the pandemic.

Throughout history, vaccines have had a profound impact on public health, saving countless lives and preventing the spread of deadly diseases. They remain a cornerstone of modern medicine and continue to be a vital tool in the prevention of infectious diseases.",0
"Vaccination has a long and fascinating history. According to the World Health Organization 1, humans have been attempting to protect each other against deadly diseases for centuries. The practice of variolation, or intentionally exposing healthy people to smallpox, dates back to at least the 15th century and possibly as early as 200 BCE 1. In 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu brought smallpox inoculation to Europe by asking that her two daughters be inoculated against smallpox as she had observed the practice in Turkey 1. In 1774, Benjamin Jesty tested his hypothesis that infection with cowpox could protect a person from smallpox 1. In May 1796, English physician Edward Jenner expanded on this discovery and inoculated 8-year-old James Phipps with matter collected from a cowpox sore on the hand of a milkmaid. Two months later, in July 1796, Jenner inoculated Phipps with matter from a human smallpox sore in order to test PhippsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ resistance. Phipps remained in perfect health and became the first human to be vaccinated against smallpox 1. The term Ã¢â‚¬ËœvaccineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is later coined, taken from the Latin word for cow, vacca 1.

Louis Pasteur created the first laboratory-produced vaccine for fowl cholera in chickens in 1872 despite enduring a stroke and the death of two of his daughters to typhoid 1. In 1885, Pasteur successfully prevented rabies through post-exposure vaccination by injecting a human with a disease agent 1. In 1894, Dr Anna Wessels Williams isolated a strain of the diphtheria bacteria that was crucial in the development of an antitoxin for the disease 1.

The Spanish Flu pandemic killed an estimated 20Ã¢â‚¬â€œ50 million people worldwide from 1918 to 1919, including one in every 67 United States soldiers. This made an influenza vaccine a US military priority 1.

The history of vaccinations dates back centuries, to a practice known as variolation. Variolation involved exposing people to smallpox scabs, in the hope that they would develop a mild infection and become immune to the disease. Variolation was practiced in China and India as early as the 10th century, and it was introduced to Europe in the 18th century by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.

In 1796, Edward Jenner, an English physician, developed the first vaccine against smallpox. Jenner observed that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox were immune to smallpox. He hypothesized that cowpox could be used to protect people from smallpox. Jenner tested his hypothesis by inoculating a young boy with cowpox pus. The boy developed a mild case of cowpox, but he did not develop smallpox when he was exposed to the disease later on.

Jenner's discovery revolutionized the field of medicine. Vaccines were developed against other diseases, such as rabies, cholera, and diphtheria, in the 19th century. In the 20th century, vaccines were developed against polio, measles, mumps, and rubella.

Vaccines have had a profound impact on public health. Smallpox was eradicated in 1980 thanks to a global vaccination campaign. Polio is on the verge of eradication, and measles and rubella have been eliminated in many countries. Vaccines have also saved millions of lives from other diseases, such as diphtheria, cholera, and tetanus.

Today, vaccines are one of the most effective public health interventions available. They are safe and effective, and they have helped to prevent millions of deaths and illnesses.

Here is a timeline of some key events in the history of vaccinations:

1796: Edward Jenner develops the first vaccine against smallpox.
1823: Louis Pasteur develops the first vaccine against rabies.
1885: Louis Pasteur successfully prevents rabies through post-exposure vaccination.
1884: Carl Fraenkel develops the first vaccine against tetanus.

"The main function of the circulatory system is to provide oxygen, nutrients and hormones to muscles, tissues and organs throughout your body. Another part of the circulatory system is to remove waste from cells and organs so your body can dispose of it.",0
"The human circulatory system, often referred to as the cardiovascular system, plays a vital role in maintaining the overall health and functioning of the body. Its primary functions include:

Transportation of Oxygen and Nutrients: The circulatory system carries oxygen and essential nutrients from the lungs and the digestive system, respectively, to the cells of the body. Oxygen is crucial for cellular respiration, the process by which cells produce energy.

Removal of Waste Products: It also transports waste products, such as carbon dioxide and metabolic waste, away from the cells to be eliminated from the body. Carbon dioxide is transported to the lungs, where it is exhaled.

Circulation of Hormones: Hormones produced by various glands are transported through the bloodstream to target organs and tissues, regulating various bodily functions and maintaining homeostasis.

Immune Response: The circulatory system helps distribute white blood cells and antibodies to fight off infections and diseases. It also plays a role in transporting immune cells to sites of injury or infection.

Regulation of Body Temperature: Blood circulation helps distribute heat throughout the body, aiding in the regulation of body temperature. Blood vessels dilate to release heat, and they constrict to conserve heat.

Maintenance of pH and Electrolyte Balance: The circulatory system helps maintain the body's pH level and electrolyte balance by transporting substances like bicarbonate ions and various electrolytes.

Clotting and Wound Healing: Platelets in the blood are essential for blood clotting. When there is an injury, the circulatory system helps form blood clots to prevent excessive bleeding.

Transport of Nutrients to the Heart Muscle: The coronary circulation is a part of the circulatory system that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle itself, ensuring its proper functioning.

Blood Pressure Regulation: The circulatory system helps regulate blood pressure through the constriction and dilation of blood vessels and the control of blood volume.

The circulatory system consists of the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood. It operates as a closed-loop system, with the heart acting as the central pump that propels blood throughout the body. The efficient functioning of the circulatory system is essential for sustaining life and maintaining the health of the body's various organs and tissues.

"The human circulatory system is responsible for performing several vital functions that are essential for the survival of the body. According to the Cleveland Clinic, some of the primary functions of the circulatory system include:

Providing oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to muscles, tissues, and organs throughout the body.
Removing waste from cells and organs so that the body can dispose of it.
Transporting blood and lymph throughout the body.
Maintaining blood pressure and body temperature.
Protecting the body from disease-causing microorganisms and foreign substances 1.

The human circulatory system is a network of blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body. It is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other essential substances to all the cells in the body, as well as removing waste products. The circulatory system is also vital for regulating body temperature and fighting infection.

The main components of the circulatory system are the heart, blood vessels, and blood. The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood through the blood vessels. Blood vessels are divided into three types: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry blood away from the heart, while veins carry blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins, and they are where the exchange of oxygen and nutrients between the blood and the tissues takes place.

The circulatory system has two main circuits: the pulmonary circuit and the systemic circuit. The pulmonary circuit carries blood from the heart to the lungs and back again, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. The systemic circuit carries blood from the heart to all the other organs and tissues in the body and back again, where it delivers oxygen and nutrients and removes waste products.

The circulatory system is essential for life. It allows the body to function properly by delivering the substances that the cells need to survive and removing the waste products that the cells produce.

Here are some of the specific functions of the human circulatory system:

Transporting oxygen: The circulatory system is responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to all the cells in the body. Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration, the process by which cells convert food into energy.
Transporting nutrients: The circulatory system also transports nutrients from the digestive system to the cells in the body. Nutrients are essential for cell growth and repair.
Transporting hormones: Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate a variety of bodily functions. The circulatory system transports hormones from the glands that produce them to the cells where they act.
Removing waste products: The circulatory system removes waste products from the cells in the body and transports them to the excretory organs, such as the kidneys and lungs, where they can be removed from the body.
Regulating body temperature: The circulatory system helps to regulate body temperature by distributing heat throughout the body.
Fighting infection: The circulatory system plays a role in fighting infection by transporting white blood cells and other immune system components to the sites of infection.

Antibiotics can be life-saving when used to treat serious infections. However, it is important to note that antibiotics cannot treat viral infections, such as the common cold or the flu.

Antibiotics should only be used when necessary, and only under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance, which is a serious public health threat.

Here are some of the ways that antibiotics work to treat infections:

Killing bacteria: Some antibiotics kill bacteria by interfering with their cell walls, which are essential for their survival.
Preventing bacteria from multiplying: Other antibiotics prevent bacteria from multiplying by interfering with their DNA or protein synthesis.
Disrupting bacterial communication: Some antibiotics work by disrupting the way that bacteria communicate with each other, which can make it more difficult for them to cause an infection.
Antibiotics are a powerful tool for treating infections, but it is important to use them wisely. By only using antibiotics when necessary and following your healthcare provider's instructions, you can help to prevent antibiotic resistance.

"If the proteins on a donor organ are too different from the antigens in the recipient's body, the recipient's immune system will attack the new organ. That's why it's very important for doctors to match a donor and recipient's blood type and tissue type antigens as closely as possible.",0
"Organ transplantation is a complex medical procedure that involves the replacement of a diseased or damaged organ in a recipient with a healthy organ from a donor. The science behind organ transplantation is based on principles of immunology, surgery, and medical management. Here's an overview of the key aspects of the science behind organ transplantation:

Immunology: The immune system plays a central role in organ transplantation. When a foreign organ is transplanted into a recipient, the recipient's immune system recognizes the transplanted organ as foreign and attempts to reject it. To mitigate this rejection, immunosuppressive drugs are administered to suppress the recipient's immune response. The careful selection of donors and recipients based on tissue compatibility, particularly the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, helps reduce the risk of rejection.

Tissue Typing: Before a transplant, both the donor and recipient are subjected to HLA typing to assess the degree of compatibility. A close match in HLA markers between the donor and recipient reduces the risk of rejection and improves the chances of a successful transplant.

Organ Procurement: Organs for transplantation are sourced from deceased or living donors. The process of organ procurement requires meticulous surgical procedures to ensure the organ's viability during transport to the recipient. Living donors typically donate organs such as kidneys or a portion of their liver, while deceased donors can provide organs like the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas.

Surgical Techniques: The transplantation procedure itself involves complex surgical techniques. Surgeons must carefully remove the diseased organ from the recipient and replace it with the healthy donor organ. In some cases, this requires connecting blood vessels and other tissues to ensure proper function.

Immunosuppression: To prevent the recipient's immune system from rejecting the transplanted organ, a combination of immunosuppressive medications is prescribed. These drugs reduce the activity of immune cells that would otherwise attack the new organ. The dosage and specific medications used may be adjusted over time to balance the need for immunosuppression with the risk of side effects and infections.

Post-Transplant Monitoring: After the transplant, ongoing medical management is crucial. The recipient's health is closely monitored for signs of rejection, infection, and other complications. Regular check-ups and tests are conducted to assess the function of the transplanted organ.

Rejection Management: If rejection occurs, healthcare providers may adjust the immunosuppressive regimen or use other treatments to manage the rejection and protect the transplanted organ.

Ethical and Legal Considerations: The science of organ transplantation is also accompanied by ethical and legal considerations. Donor consent, organ allocation, and transplantation policies and regulations vary by country and region.

Advancements in Transplantation: Ongoing research and medical advancements have led to improvements in organ preservation, immunosuppressive medications, and surgical techniques. These developments aim to enhance the success rates of organ transplantation and reduce the risks associated with the procedure.

Organ transplantation has saved countless lives and significantly improved the quality of life for many recipients. However, it is a complex and evolving field that continues to face challenges such as organ shortages and the need for improved immunosuppressive strategies. Researchers and healthcare professionals work to advance the science of transplantation to increase the availability of organs and improve outcomes for recipients.",0
"Organ transplantation is a medical procedure that involves removing a healthy organ from one person and surgically placing it in another person 1. The person who donates the healthy organ is called the donor, and the person who receives the healthy organ is called the recipient 1. The first successful organ transplant was a skin transplant performed by a Swiss doctor named Jacques-Louis Reverdin in 1869 1. Since then, organ transplantation has come a long way. In 1954, the first successful kidney transplant was performed by Joseph Murray in Boston, Massachusetts 1. Today, organ transplants are an important step in medical history and provide a new way to help people suffering from organ failure or incurable disease 1.

The science behind organ transplantation is called transplant immunology. It is the study of how the immune system responds to transplanted organs and how to prevent rejection of these organs 2. The immune system is designed to protect the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. When an organ is transplanted from one person to another, the immune system recognizes it as foreign and tries to destroy it. This process is called rejection. To prevent rejection, doctors use immunosuppressive drugs that suppress the immune systemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response to the transplanted organ 2.

Organ transplantation has saved countless lives and continues to be an important area of research in medicine. It has helped people suffering from organ failure or incurable disease to lead normal lives 1.",0
"The science behind organ transplantation is complex, but it is essentially based on the idea that the body can accept and tolerate a healthy organ from another person. This is possible because the body's immune system is able to distinguish between the body's own cells and foreign cells. However, the immune system will also attack a transplanted organ if it is not properly matched to the recipient.

Matching donor and recipient

When a patient is being considered for an organ transplant, it is important to match the donor and recipient as closely as possible in terms of blood type and tissue type. Blood type compatibility is important because it prevents the recipient's body from attacking the donor organ's red blood cells. Tissue type compatibility is important because it helps to reduce the risk of the recipient's body rejecting the donor organ.

Immunosuppression

Even after a donor and recipient have been carefully matched, the recipient's immune system may still attack the transplanted organ. To prevent this, patients must take immunosuppressive drugs, which suppress the immune system's activity. Immunosuppressive drugs are a lifelong requirement after organ transplantation.

Rejection

Despite immunosuppressive drugs, organ rejection can still occur. This can happen if the recipient's immune system becomes too active or if the donor organ is damaged. Rejection can be a serious complication, and it can lead to the loss of the transplanted organ.

Advances in transplantation science

Transplantation science has come a long way in recent years. Researchers are developing new immunosuppressive drugs that are more effective and have fewer side effects. They are also working on ways to induce tolerance in transplant patients, which would mean that they would no longer need to take immunosuppressive drugs.

Types of organ transplants

The most common types of organ transplants are:

Kidney transplant
Heart transplant
Liver transplant
Lung transplant
Pancreas transplant
Other types of organ transplants include:

Bone marrow transplant
Small intestine transplant
Corneal transplant
Uterus transplant
Conclusion

Organ transplantation is a complex medical procedure, but it can save lives and improve the quality of life for people with organ failure. The science behind organ transplantation is constantly evolving, and researchers are working to make organ transplantation safer and more successful.",0

"Medical ethics is a branch of ethics that deals with moral issues and principles in the field of healthcare and medicine. It provides a framework for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers to make morally sound decisions and navigate complex ethical dilemmas. The philosophy of medical ethics is based on several key principles and concepts:

Autonomy: Autonomy is the principle of respecting an individual's right to make decisions about their own healthcare. In medical ethics, this means obtaining informed consent from patients before any medical procedures, respecting their right to refuse treatment, and ensuring that they are well-informed about their medical options.

Beneficence: Beneficence is the principle of doing good and promoting the well-being of patients. Healthcare professionals have a moral obligation to act in the best interests of their patients and provide care that maximizes the patient's welfare.

Non-Maleficence: Non-maleficence, often expressed as ""first, do no harm,"" emphasizes the importance of not causing harm to patients. Healthcare professionals should strive to minimize the potential harm associated with medical interventions and prioritize the safety and well-being of patients.

Justice: The principle of justice requires that medical resources and care be distributed fairly and equitably. This includes addressing issues of healthcare access, resource allocation, and the elimination of discrimination in healthcare.

Veracity: Veracity is the principle of honesty and truth-telling. Healthcare professionals should be truthful and transparent when communicating with patients, ensuring that they provide accurate information about diagnoses, treatment options, and potential outcomes.

Confidentiality: The principle of confidentiality obligates healthcare providers to protect the privacy of patient information. Patient medical records and personal information must be kept secure and only shared with those directly involved in the patient's care.

Fidelity: Fidelity emphasizes the importance of loyalty, trustworthiness, and fulfilling commitments. Healthcare professionals are expected to be faithful to their patients, colleagues, and the healthcare system, maintaining the trust placed in them.

Informed Consent: Informed consent is a fundamental aspect of medical ethics. It requires that patients have sufficient information to make decisions about their medical care, including potential risks, benefits, and alternatives. Healthcare providers must obtain the patient's voluntary and informed consent before any medical procedures.

End-of-Life Care: Medical ethics also addresses complex issues related to end-of-life care, including decisions about withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, advance directives, and the management of patients in critical conditions.

Research Ethics: Medical ethics extends to the ethical conduct of medical research, including the protection of research participants, the responsible use of human and animal subjects, and the ethical review of research proposals.

Medical ethics serves as a moral compass in the practice of medicine, helping healthcare professionals navigate challenging ethical dilemmas and make decisions that prioritize the well-being and rights of patients.

"Marketing redistributes our attention from certain trends and products to other ones. It tells us what to be focused on and what to discuss today, making it irrelevant the next day and replacing it with the new stuff, so we have something to occupy our minds with.",0
"Marketing has a significant impact on consumer behavior, influencing the way individuals make decisions about what to buy and from whom to buy. This influence is based on various principles and strategies that marketers use to appeal to consumers' needs, wants, and preferences. Here's how marketing impacts consumer behavior:

Information and Awareness: Marketing serves as a means of providing information and creating awareness about products and services. Through advertisements, content marketing, social media, and other channels, consumers become aware of the existence and benefits of various products and brands.

Perception and Attitudes: Marketing can shape consumers' perceptions and attitudes toward products and brands. Effective marketing campaigns can create a positive image of a product or brand, leading consumers to associate it with desirable qualities.

Emotion and Desire: Marketing often taps into consumers' emotions to create desire. Advertisements that evoke emotions like happiness, nostalgia, or a sense of belonging can influence purchasing decisions by making products more appealing.

Influence of Social Norms: Marketing can reinforce social norms and trends. For example, a product positioned as a ""must-have"" or ""trendy"" item can encourage consumers to conform to societal expectations or aspirations.

Information Search: Consumers frequently engage in information search before making a purchase decision. Marketing materials, such as product descriptions, reviews, and comparisons, play a crucial role in providing the information consumers need to make informed choices.

Brand Loyalty: Consistent and effective marketing efforts can build brand loyalty. When consumers have positive experiences with a brand and its products, they are more likely to remain loyal and make repeat purchases.

Price and Promotion Strategies: Marketing often highlights pricing and promotional strategies, such as discounts, sales, or loyalty programs. These tactics can impact consumer behavior by creating a sense of urgency, encouraging bulk buying, or fostering customer retention.

Trust and Credibility: Trustworthiness and credibility are essential in consumer decision-making. Marketing can convey trust through endorsements, customer reviews, certifications, and transparent communication, influencing consumers to choose a product or service they believe is reliable.

Social Proof: Marketing leverages social proof, demonstrating that others have already made similar choices. Testimonials, ratings, and user-generated content can influence consumers by showing that a product is well-regarded by others.

Behavioral Economics: Principles of behavioral economics, such as anchoring, scarcity, and the endowment effect, are often used in marketing to nudge consumers toward specific decisions or behaviors.

Personalization: With the advent of digital marketing, personalization has become a powerful tool. Tailoring marketing messages and product recommendations to an individual's preferences and past behaviors can significantly impact consumer choices.

Call to Action: Effective marketing often includes a clear call to action, prompting consumers to take a specific step, such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or requesting more information.

In summary, marketing plays a central role in shaping consumer behavior by providing information, creating emotional connections, influencing perceptions, and guiding decision-making. Marketers use a variety of strategies and tactics to engage consumers and encourage them to take desired actions, ultimately impacting their purchasing decisions and brand preferences.",0
"Marketing can have a significant impact on consumer behavior by influencing consumer decision-making at various stages in the consumerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mindset 1. Marketing and advertising can make consumers aware of the benefits of products and services, and persuade them to choose specific products over others 1. Marketing can also control some factors that affect consumer behavior, such as store layout, pricing, and promotions 1. However, consumers ultimately decide if they want to be influenced by marketing and what they want to buy and when 1.

There are several factors that influence consumer behavior, including psychological, social, cultural, and economic factors 2. Consumers are often driven by their past experiences and emotions, and changes in external environments such as rising prices or trends in the market can shape consumer buying behavior and habits 2.

Marketing can influence consumer behavior in several ways. For example:

Creating brand awareness: Marketing can help create brand awareness by making consumers aware of a product or service 1.
Influencing purchase decisions: Marketing can influence purchase decisions by providing information about a product or service that makes it more attractive to consumers 1.
Building trust: Marketing can help build trust between a company and its customers by providing information about the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s products or services 1.
Creating a sense of urgency: Marketing can create a sense of urgency by using tactics such as limited-time offers or flash sales to encourage consumers to make a purchase 1.
In conclusion, marketing has a significant impact on consumer behavior. By understanding the factors that influence consumer behavior, businesses can develop effective marketing campaigns that cater to the needs and wants of their target audience 3.",0

Marketing has a significant impact on consumer behavior. By understanding how consumers think and make decisions, marketers can develop strategies to influence those decisions.

Here are some of the ways that marketing impacts consumer behavior:

Awareness: Marketing helps to create awareness of brands and products. Consumers are more likely to buy products that they are aware of and that they have a positive association with.
Consideration: Marketing helps to move consumers from awareness to consideration. This involves providing consumers with information about the product or service and its benefits.
Preference: Marketing helps to create a preference for one brand or product over another. This involves highlighting the unique features and benefits of the product or service.
Purchase: Marketing can encourage consumers to take the final step and purchase the product or service. This can be done through promotional offers, discounts, and other incentives.
Post-purchase: Marketing can also influence consumer behavior after they have purchased the product or service. This can be done through customer support, loyalty programs, and other initiatives.
Marketers use a variety of tools and strategies to influence consumer behavior. These include:

Advertising: Advertising is one of the most common marketing tools. It is used to create awareness of brands and products, and to persuade consumers to buy them. Advertising can be done through a variety of channels, including television, radio, print, and online.
Public relations: Public relations is used to manage the public's perception of a brand or product. It can be used to generate positive publicity and to build relationships with key influencers.
Sales promotion: Sales promotion includes activities such as coupons, discounts, and contests. It is used to encourage consumers to try new products or to buy more of a product that they already use.
Direct marketing: Direct marketing involves communicating directly with consumers through channels such as email, direct mail, and telemarketing. It is used to build relationships with consumers and to promote products and services.
Social media marketing: Social media marketing involves using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to connect with consumers and promote products and services.
Marketers use data and analytics to understand consumer behavior and to develop effective marketing campaigns. By understanding how consumers think and make decisions, marketers can influence those decisions and drive sales.

Here are some examples of how marketing can impact consumer behavior:

A consumer sees a TV commercial for a new smartphone that they have never seen before. The commercial highlights the phone's new features and benefits, such as its long battery life and high-quality camera. The consumer is now aware of the phone and is considering buying it.
A consumer receives an email from their favorite clothing store announcing a sale on jeans. The consumer is already familiar with the store and has a positive association with it. The sale provides an incentive for the consumer to purchase jeans from the store.
A consumer sees a social media post from a friend about a new restaurant that they recently tried. The friend's post is positive and includes photos of the food. The consumer is now aware of the restaurant and is considering trying it.
Marketing is a powerful tool that can be used to influence consumer behavior at all stages of the purchase process. By understanding how consumers think and make decisions, marketers can develop effective marketing campaigns that drive sales and build brand loyalty.

"Venture capital provides funding to new businesses that do not have access to stock markets and do not have enough cash flow to take on debts. This arrangement can be mutually beneficial because businesses get the capital they need to bootstrap their operations, and investors gain equity in promising companies.",0
"Venture capital (VC) plays a crucial role in the startup ecosystem by providing funding and support to early-stage and high-potential companies. The role of venture capital in startups can be summarized as follows:

Seed and Early-Stage Funding: Venture capital firms typically invest in startups at the seed and early stages of development when they may not yet have a proven business model or significant revenue. This early funding is often essential for product development, market research, and initial market entry.

Risk Capital: Venture capital is often referred to as risk capital because VC firms are willing to invest in startups with high-risk, high-reward potential. These investments are riskier than traditional loans or other forms of financing, but they offer the possibility of substantial returns if the startup succeeds.

Capital for Growth: VC firms provide startups with the financial resources needed to fuel their growth and expansion. This capital can be used for scaling operations, increasing market share, hiring talent, and entering new markets.

Expertise and Mentorship: Venture capitalists often bring valuable industry experience, networks, and business expertise to the startups they invest in. They can offer guidance on strategic decision-making, business development, and management, helping the startup navigate challenges and make informed choices.

Access to Networks: VC firms have extensive networks of contacts, including other entrepreneurs, investors, and professionals in various industries. Startups that receive VC funding can tap into these networks for partnerships, introductions, and business development opportunities.

Due Diligence: Venture capitalists conduct thorough due diligence before investing in a startup. This process helps ensure that the startup has a viable business model, a market opportunity, and a competent team. This due diligence can add credibility to the startup.

Exit Strategies: Venture capital firms typically invest with the expectation of a profitable exit, such as through an initial public offering (IPO), acquisition by a larger company, or a merger. These exit strategies can provide significant returns to both the startup and the VC investors.

Long-Term Perspective: Venture capital firms often have a longer time horizon than other types of investors, such as angel investors. They understand that startups may take several years to become profitable and are patient in waiting for a return on their investment.

Innovation and Job Creation: Venture capital funding supports innovation and the development of new technologies and business models. Successful startups can create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and contribute to industry advancements.

Risk Sharing: VC firms share the risks associated with startup investments. If the startup fails, the venture capital firm absorbs the losses, which can be substantial. However, if the startup succeeds, both the startup founders and the VC firm benefit.

It's important to note that while venture capital can provide significant benefits to startups, it also involves giving up equity in the company and accepting input from investors. This trade-off is a fundamental aspect of the venture capital model, and startups should carefully consider the implications of accepting VC funding for their business.

"Venture capital (VC) is a type of financing that investors provide to startups and small businesses that have the potential for substantial and rapid growth 1. VC firms raise money from limited partners to invest in promising startups or larger venture funds 1. They receive a management fee and a percentage of profits (carried interest) 1. VC funding is usually exchanged for equity in the company, and it is not expected to be paid back like a bank loan 1. VC firms are in the business of generating returns for their investors, and that is the most important thing they consider when evaluating a startup 1. VC can also be provided in the form of technical or managerial expertise 1.

VC is a great option for startups that are looking to scale big and quickly 2. The goal of a VC investment is a very high return, usually in the form of an acquisition or an IPO 1. Because the investments are fairly large, your startup has to be prepared to take that money and grow 2. The biggest advantage of working with venture capital firms is that if your startup goes under Ã¢â‚¬â€ as most do Ã¢â‚¬â€ youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not on the hook for the money because unlike a loan, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no obligation to pay it back 2. Venture capitalists come to the table with a lot of business and institutional knowledge. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re also well-connected with other businesses that could help you and your startups, professionals that you might want to take on as employees, and Ã¢â‚¬â€ obviously Ã¢â‚¬â€ other investors 2.

While you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t technically have to Ã¢â‚¬Å“pay backÃ¢â‚¬Â venture capital, venture capital firms are expecting a return on their investment. That means that a startup that accepts VC money needs to be planning for an exit of some kind, usually an acquisition or an IPO. If thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not your goal Ã¢â‚¬â€ or if you see yourself running your startup forever Ã¢â‚¬â€ then venture capital is not for you. On that note, part of what venture capitalists want in return for their investment is equity in a startup. That means that you give up part of their ownership when you bring on venture capital. Depending on the deal, a VC may even end up with a majority share Ã¢â‚¬â€ more than 50 percent ownerships Ã¢â‚¬â€ of a startup. If that happens, you essentially lose management control of your company 2.",0

Venture capital (VC) plays a critical role in the startup ecosystem. VCs provide funding to early-stage companies that have the potential for high growth. This funding can help startups to develop their products and services, hire employees, and expand their customer base.

VCs typically invest in startups that are in the seed, early-stage, or growth stages. Seed-stage startups are typically developing their product or service and have not yet generated any revenue. Early-stage startups have a product or service that is generating revenue, but they are still in the process of growing their business. Growth-stage startups have a proven product or service and are looking to expand their market share or enter new markets.

VCs invest in startups for a number of reasons. First, they believe that startups have the potential to generate high returns on investment. Second, VCs want to help startups succeed and become innovative leaders in their industries. Third, VCs want to build relationships with entrepreneurs and help them to achieve their goals.

VCs provide more than just funding to startups. They also provide mentorship, guidance, and access to their network of contacts. This can be invaluable to startups that are trying to navigate the complex world of business.

Here are some of the benefits that startups can receive from venture capital funding:

Funding for growth: VC funding can help startups to develop their products and services, hire employees, and expand their customer base.
Mentorship and guidance: VCs can provide startups with valuable mentorship and guidance from experienced business leaders.
Access to networks: VCs can help startups to connect with other entrepreneurs, investors, and potential customers.
Credibility: VC funding can give startups a stamp of credibility and make them more attractive to customers and partners.
VC funding is not without its risks. Startups that receive VC funding must typically give up some equity in their company to the VCs. This means that the VCs will have a say in how the company is run and will be entitled to a share of the profits if the company is successful.

Overall, venture capital plays a vital role in the startup ecosystem. By providing funding, mentorship, and guidance, VCs help startups to grow and succeed.

Here are some examples of successful startups that have received venture capital funding:

Google
Facebook
Amazon
Airbnb
Uber
SpaceX
Tesla
These companies have all received millions or even billions of dollars in venture capital funding. This funding has helped them to develop their products and services, hire employees, and expand their customer bases. As a result, these companies have become some of the most successful and innovative companies in the world.",0

"CSR, in its broadest sense, explores what obligations a corporation should or can undertake to further the goals of society. Business academics have described four social responsibilities that any company has to society: economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic.",0
"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a philosophy that reflects a company's commitment to conducting its business in an ethical and socially responsible manner. It goes beyond the traditional focus on profit maximization and considers the broader impact of a company's activities on society, the environment, and various stakeholders. The philosophy of CSR is guided by several key principles:

Ethical Behavior: At the core of CSR is a commitment to ethical behavior in all aspects of a company's operations. This means adhering to moral principles and values, even when it may not directly contribute to short-term financial gains.

Accountability: CSR encourages companies to be accountable for their actions and decisions. This includes taking responsibility for the consequences of their operations and making amends when they have a negative impact on society or the environment.

Transparency: Transparency is essential in CSR. Companies should provide clear and honest information about their operations, business practices, and their social and environmental impacts. This transparency builds trust with stakeholders.

Sustainability: CSR emphasizes the importance of sustainable practices. This includes efforts to reduce a company's environmental footprint, conserve resources, and operate in a way that is beneficial to both the present and future generations.

Stakeholder Engagement: Companies should engage with and consider the interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders. This includes employees, customers, suppliers, the local community, and other groups affected by the company's activities.

Community Involvement: CSR encourages companies to contribute positively to the communities in which they operate. This can take the form of philanthropy, supporting local initiatives, or investing in community development projects.

Employee Well-Being: A socially responsible company values the well-being of its employees. This includes providing fair wages, safe working conditions, opportunities for professional growth, and a healthy work-life balance.

Environmental Responsibility: Companies should minimize their environmental impact by adopting sustainable practices, reducing waste, conserving resources, and working to combat climate change.

Product Responsibility: CSR extends to the quality and safety of a company's products or services. Companies are expected to provide safe and reliable products and, when necessary, recall or address defects promptly.

Ethical Sourcing: CSR also covers the sourcing of materials and components. Companies are encouraged to ensure that their supply chains are free from exploitation, child labor, and unethical practices.

Global Citizenship: CSR can extend to the global stage, with companies taking responsibility for their global impact. This includes considerations of fair trade, human rights, and international labor standards.

Legal and Regulatory Compliance: CSR requires adherence to laws and regulations, but it often goes beyond mere compliance. Companies are encouraged to set higher ethical standards for themselves.

The philosophy of CSR is not only a moral imperative but also makes good business sense. Companies that adopt CSR principles often enjoy enhanced reputations, stronger customer and employee loyalty, improved risk management, and a better long-term financial performance. CSR can also help companies contribute to solving some of the world's most pressing social and environmental challenges. As a result, many businesses today incorporate CSR into their core values and operations.

"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a concept that involves companies integrating social and environmental concerns in their business operations and interactions with their stakeholders 1. CSR can be seen as a way of balancing economic, environmental, and social imperatives while also addressing the expectations of shareholders and stakeholders 1. CSR is not clearly defined, but it generally refers to the moral and ethical obligations of a company with regards to various areas of life that its business affects 1. CSR can be a strategic business management concept, not just charity, sponsorships, or philanthropy 1. CSR can also be guided by the idea of the triple bottom line, which means pursuing profit, people, and the planet 1. CSR activities are usually voluntary and aim to have a positive influence on the world 1.

In recent years, many organizations have embraced CSR as a philosophy in which the companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expected actions include not only producing a reliable product, charging a fair price with fair profit margins, and paying a fair wage to employees but also caring for the environment and acting on other social concerns 2. Many corporations work on prosocial endeavors and share that information with their customers and the communities where they do business. CSR, when conducted in good faith, is beneficial to corporations and their stakeholders. This is especially true for stakeholders that have typically been given low priority and little voice, such as the natural environment and community members who live near corporate sites and manufacturing facilities 2.",0

The philosophy of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is that businesses have a responsibility to society beyond simply making a profit. CSR can be defined as the obligations of organizations to their stakeholders. In a business context, stakeholders are individuals or groups that are affected by the actions of a business. This can include employees, customers, suppliers, the community, and the environment.

The philosophy of CSR is based on the belief that businesses have a moral obligation to use their resources and influence to make a positive impact on society. This can involve a variety of activities, such as:

Providing fair wages and benefits to employees
Operating in an environmentally sustainable way
Supporting charitable causes
Investing in the community
Upholding ethical standards in business practices
CSR is not just about doing good for society, it can also be good for business. Studies have shown that CSR can lead to increased employee morale, productivity, and customer loyalty. It can also help businesses to attract and retain top talent.

There are a number of different approaches to CSR. Some businesses focus on philanthropic activities, while others focus on integrating social and environmental responsibility into their core business operations. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to CSR, and the best approach for a particular business will depend on its unique circumstances.

The philosophy of CSR is still evolving, but it is becoming increasingly important for businesses of all sizes. As businesses become more global and interconnected, they are increasingly being held accountable for their impact on society. CSR can help businesses to be more responsible and sustainable, and it can also help them to build stronger relationships with their stakeholders.

Here are some examples of how businesses are practicing CSR:

Patagonia donates 1% of its sales to environmental causes.
Ben & Jerry's uses Fairtrade ingredients in its ice cream.
Tesla is developing sustainable electric vehicles.
Walmart is working to reduce its environmental impact.
Google is committed to diversity and inclusion in its workplace.

Production and Manufacturing: Once the necessary inputs are procured, the production or manufacturing process begins. This stage involves transforming raw materials or components into finished products through various manufacturing processes.

Logistics and Distribution: After production, the finished products need to be transported and distributed to various points in the supply chain. This includes activities such as warehousing, inventory management, transportation, and order fulfillment.

Wholesalers and Retailers: Many supply chains involve intermediaries such as wholesalers and retailers. Wholesalers buy products from manufacturers in bulk and distribute them to retailers, who then sell to consumers.

Consumers: The ultimate end of the supply chain is the consumer, who purchases and uses the products or services. Meeting consumer demand is a central focus of supply chain management.

Information Flow: In addition to the flow of physical goods, supply chains also involve the exchange of information. This includes order processing, inventory data, demand forecasts, and communication with suppliers and partners.

Supply Chain Management (SCM): SCM refers to the coordination and optimization of all supply chain activities to ensure efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and timely delivery of products. It involves planning, controlling, and monitoring the supply chain processes.

Sustainability and Ethics: Modern supply chains also consider sustainability and ethical considerations. This includes efforts to reduce environmental impact, ethical sourcing of materials, and responsible labor practices.

Global Supply Chains: Many supply chains are global in nature, involving the movement of goods and services across international borders. This complexity can introduce challenges related to tariffs, trade regulations, and cultural differences.

Effective supply chain management is critical for businesses to meet customer demand, control costs, reduce lead times, and remain competitive in the market. It requires careful planning, coordination, and the use of technology and data analytics to optimize processes and respond to changing market conditions.

Supply chain disruptions, such as those caused by natural disasters, economic changes, or global crises, can have significant impacts on businesses, underscoring the importance of robust supply chain planning and risk management. The concept of a supply chain is central to modern business operations, and it continues to evolve with advancements in technology, globalization, and changing consumer expectations.

"A supply chain is a network of businesses, individuals, and organizations involved in the creation and delivery of a product or service to the end customer 1. It includes all the activities that are involved in the production, transportation, and distribution of goods and services from the supplier to the customer 2. The supply chain starts with the raw materials and ends with the delivery of the finished product to the end customer 2. The goal of a supply chain is to create value for customers by delivering products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner 1.

A typical supply chain consists of several stages, including:

Raw material acquisition: The first stage of the supply chain involves acquiring raw materials from suppliers.
Manufacturing: The raw materials are then transformed into finished products through manufacturing processes.
Distribution: The finished products are then transported to distribution centers or warehouses.
Retail: The products are then sold to retailers or directly to customers.
After-sales service: After-sales service involves providing support to customers after they have purchased a product.
Effective supply chain management is essential for businesses to remain competitive in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s global economy 1. By optimizing their supply chains, businesses can reduce costs, improve efficiency, and increase customer satisfaction 1. Supply chain management involves coordinating all the activities involved in the supply chain, from procurement to delivery, in order to maximize value for customers 2.",0
"A supply chain in business is a network of people, organizations, resources, activities, and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product or service. It encompasses everything from the delivery of raw materials from the supplier to the manufacturer through to its eventual delivery to the end user.

The supply chain is a complex and interconnected system, and each stage plays an important role in the overall success of the business. For example, if suppliers are unable to deliver raw materials on time or to specification, this can cause delays and disruptions in the production process. Similarly, if there are problems with transportation or logistics, this can also impact the delivery of the product to the customer.

As a result, it is important for businesses to carefully manage their supply chains and to ensure that all stages of the process are working efficiently. This can be achieved by using various supply chain management techniques, such as just-in-time inventory and lean manufacturing.

By effectively managing their supply chains, businesses can improve their customer service, reduce costs, and increase their overall profitability.

Here are some examples of the different stages of a supply chain:

Sourcing: This involves finding and procuring the raw materials and components that are needed to produce the product or service.
Manufacturing: This involves converting the raw materials and components into the finished product.
Warehousing and distribution: This involves storing the finished product and delivering it to the customer.
Sales and marketing: This involves promoting the product or service to potential customers and generating sales.
Each stage of the supply chain is important, and all stages must work together efficiently in order for the business to be successful.

Here are some of the benefits of effective supply chain management:

Reduced costs: By streamlining the supply chain and eliminating waste, businesses can reduce their overall costs.
Improved customer service: By ensuring that products are delivered to customers on time and in good condition, businesses can improve their customer service.
Increased profitability: By reducing costs and improving customer service, businesses can increase their overall profitability.
Overall, the supply chain is a critical part of any business, and effective supply chain management is essential for success.

"Branding and brand identity are fundamental concepts in marketing and business that are closely related but represent distinct aspects of how a company presents itself to the public. Let's explore each concept:

Branding:

Branding is the overall strategy and practice of creating a unique and distinctive image for a company, product, or service in the minds of consumers. It encompasses the emotional and psychological relationship between the brand and its audience. Key elements of branding include:

Brand Promise: This is the value or benefits that consumers can expect to receive from the brand. It sets the expectations for the customer experience.

Brand Positioning: Brand positioning involves determining how the brand is perceived in relation to competitors. It's about finding a unique place in the market that sets the brand apart.

Brand Values: These are the core beliefs and principles that the brand stands for. Brand values help create a sense of purpose and connection with customers who share those values.

Brand Personality: Brands are often personified with human characteristics. The brand's personality helps establish a connection with the target audience. It could be friendly, authoritative, innovative, or other characteristics.

Brand identity is the tangible and visual representation of the brand that helps create a recognizable and memorable image. It includes the specific elements and assets used to express the brand to the public. Key elements of brand identity include:

"Branding is the process of creating a unique name and image for a product or service in the minds of consumers. Brand identity is the specific set of characteristics that make a brand unique and recognizable.

Branding is important because it helps consumers to identify and remember products and services. It also helps consumers to form positive associations with products and services. A strong brand can give consumers confidence in the quality of a product or service, and it can also make them feel good about using the product or service.

Brand identity is made up of a number of elements, including the brand name, logo, tagline, design, and messaging. These elements should be consistent and well-coordinated to create a strong and recognizable brand identity.

Here are some examples of strong brands with well-defined brand identities:

Apple: Apple's brand identity is associated with innovation, quality, and simplicity. The Apple logo is instantly recognizable, and the company's products are known for their sleek design and user-friendly interface.
Nike: Nike's brand identity is associated with performance, athleticism, and victory. The Nike swoosh logo is one of the most recognizable logos in the world, and the company's products are known for their high quality and performance.
Coca-Cola: Coca-Cola's brand identity is associated with happiness, nostalgia, and good times. The Coca-Cola logo is iconic, and the company's products are known for their unique taste and refreshing flavor.
These brands have all created strong and recognizable brand identities through the use of consistent and well-coordinated branding elements. As a result, these brands are able to command premium prices for their products and services, and they have a loyal customer base.

"The purpose of the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution is to establish and protect the basic individual liberties of the American people. It outlines specific rights and freedoms that are guaranteed to all citizens, such as freedom of speech, religion, and the right to a fair trial.",0
"The Bill of Rights is the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution, and its primary purpose is to protect individual rights and limit the powers of the federal government. These amendments were added to the Constitution in 1791, shortly after the Constitution itself was ratified. The Bill of Rights serves several important purposes:

Protection of Individual Rights: The Bill of Rights enumerates specific rights and freedoms that are guaranteed to every U.S. citizen. These rights include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to bear arms, protection against self-incrimination, the right to a fair trial, and many others. The purpose is to safeguard individual liberties from government infringement.

Limitation of Government Powers: The Bill of Rights places constraints on the federal government's authority. It prevents the government from overreaching, abusing its power, and infringing on citizens' rights. These amendments establish a balance between government authority and individual freedoms.

Protection of Minority Rights: The Bill of Rights ensures that even the smallest and most vulnerable minority groups have their rights protected. It establishes a legal framework to prevent the tyranny of the majority and protect the rights of individuals, no matter their beliefs, ethnicity, or other characteristics.

Legal Protections in the Criminal Justice System: Several amendments in the Bill of Rights are specifically designed to protect individuals involved in the criminal justice system. For example, the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination, and the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a fair and speedy trial.

Preservation of Freedom of Expression and Religion: The First Amendment, perhaps the most well-known part of the Bill of Rights, protects freedom of speech, religion, press, assembly, and the right to petition the government. This ensures that individuals can express their opinions, practice their religion, and engage in political activities without government interference.

Checks and Balances: The Bill of Rights serves as a tool for citizens and the judicial branch to hold the government accountable. If a government action is believed to violate the rights protected in the Bill of Rights, individuals can take legal action, and courts can review the constitutionality of government actions.

Protection of Property Rights: The Fifth Amendment includes the Takings Clause, which requires that when the government takes private property for public use, it must provide just compensation to the property owner.

Preservation of Privacy: While not explicitly mentioned in the Bill of Rights, several amendments, such as the Fourth Amendment, serve to protect an individual's privacy by limiting the government's ability to conduct unwarranted searches and seizures.

The Bill of Rights is a foundational document in American constitutional law and plays a critical role in shaping the legal and political framework of the United States.

The purpose of the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution is to protect the fundamental rights and liberties of the people. It is the first ten amendments to the Constitution, and it was adopted in 1791 in response to concerns that the federal government would become too powerful and would infringe on the rights of the people.

The Bill of Rights protects a wide range of rights, including the freedom of speech, religion, assembly, and the press; the right to bear arms; the right to a fair trial; and the right to due process of law. These rights are essential for a free and democratic society, and they have helped to shape the United States into the country it is today.

Here are some specific examples of how the Bill of Rights has protected the rights of the American people:

The First Amendment has protected the right of Americans to express their views, even if those views are unpopular or controversial.
The Fourth Amendment has protected the right of Americans to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
The Fifth Amendment has protected the right of Americans to due process of law and to a fair trial.
The Sixth Amendment has protected the right of Americans to be confronted by their accusers in a court of law and to have an attorney represent them.
The Eighth Amendment has protected the right of Americans from cruel and unusual punishment.
These are just a few examples of how the Bill of Rights has protected the rights of the American people. The Bill of Rights is a living document, and it continues to be interpreted and applied by the courts today. It is a cornerstone of American democracy, and it is essential for protecting the rights and liberties of the people.",0
"Definition: Civil law deals with the disputes between individuals, organizations, or between the two, in which compensation is awarded to the victim. Criminal law is the body of law that deals with crime and the legal punishment of criminal offenses.",0
"Civil law and criminal law are two distinct branches of the legal system that deal with different types of cases, legal principles, and outcomes. Here are the key differences between civil law and criminal law:

1. Nature of the Cases:

Civil Law: Civil law deals with disputes between individuals, organizations, or entities. These cases often involve claims of harm, injury, breach of contract, property disputes, or other civil wrongs. The primary aim is to seek compensation, resolution, or equitable remedies.
Criminal Law: Criminal law deals with cases in which the government (prosecution) charges an individual or entity with violating a criminal statute. These cases involve crimes against society or the state, and the primary aim is to punish the offender and protect society.
2. Parties Involved:

Civil Law: The parties involved in civil cases are typically private individuals, organizations, or entities, often referred to as ""plaintiffs"" and ""defendants.""
Criminal Law: In criminal cases, the parties involved include the government (prosecution), which brings charges against the accused (defendant). The victim may also be involved as a witness, but they are not the primary party bringing charges.
3. Burden of Proof:

Civil Law: The burden of proof in civil cases is typically the ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard, meaning that the plaintiff must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that their claim is true.
Criminal Law: In criminal cases, the burden of proof is higher, known as ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" This is a more stringent standard, requiring the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt to the point where there is no reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors.
4. Penalties and Outcomes:

Civil Law: The outcome of civil cases may result in various remedies, such as monetary damages, injunctive relief, or specific performance (fulfilling contractual obligations). The goal is to provide a remedy to the injured party.
Criminal Law: In criminal cases, the outcome may involve penalties such as fines, probation, incarceration, or other punitive measures. The goal is to punish the offender and protect society from potential harm.
5. Process and Procedure:

Civil Law: Civil cases follow a distinct legal process, which often includes pre-trial discovery, hearings, and a trial where parties present their arguments and evidence.
Criminal Law: Criminal cases have a different legal process that includes arrest, formal charging, arraignment, trial, and the possibility of an appeal.
6. Legal Representation:

Civil Law: Parties in civil cases may have legal representation, but it is not a constitutional right. Individuals may choose to represent themselves (pro se) if they wish.
Criminal Law: Defendants in criminal cases have a constitutional right to legal representation. If they cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for them (public defender) to ensure their right to a fair trial.
7. Purpose:

Civil Law: The primary purpose of civil law is to resolve disputes between parties and provide compensation or equitable remedies.
Criminal Law: The primary purpose of criminal law is to punish individuals who have committed crimes against society, deter criminal behavior, and protect the public.
It's important to note that some cases may have both civil and criminal components. For example, a car accident can lead to a civil case for compensation (e.g., a personal injury lawsuit) and a criminal case if one of the drivers was charged with reckless driving. However, the fundamental distinction between civil and criminal law remains based on the nature of the case, the parties involved, the burden of proof, and the desired outcomes.

"Civil law and criminal law are two different legal systems that deal with different types of cases. Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, while criminal law deals with offenses against the state or society 1.

The main differences between civil law and criminal law are:

How cases are initiated: In civil law, cases are initiated by a private party (the plaintiff), while in criminal law, cases are initiated by the government (the prosecution) 1.
How cases are decided: In civil law, cases are usually decided by a judge, while in criminal law, cases are almost always decided by a jury 1.
What kinds of punishment or penalty may be imposed: In civil law, the punishment almost always consists of a monetary award and never consists of imprisonment, while in criminal law, punishment for serious charges often consists of imprisonment but may also include a fine paid to the government 1.
What standards of proof must be met: In civil law, the plaintiff must establish the defendantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s liability only according to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“preponderance of evidence,Ã¢â‚¬Â while in criminal law, the prosecution must establish the guilt of the defendant Ã¢â‚¬Å“beyond a reasonable doubtÃ¢â‚¬Â 1.
What legal protections may be available to the defendant: In criminal cases, defendants are protected against conduct by police or prosecutors that violates their constitutional rights, including the right against unreasonable searches and seizures (Fourth Amendment) and the right against compelled self-incrimination (Fifth Amendment). In civil cases, defendants are not entitled to the same legal protections as are the criminally accused 1.
In summary, civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations and seeks to achieve a remedy (for example, compensation) for the injured party. Criminal law defines what activity is illegal and punishes the offender and prevents offenders from reoffending the same crime 1.",0
"
Civil law and criminal law are the two main branches of law. Civil law deals with disputes between individuals, while criminal law deals with crimes against the state.

Civil law is the body of law that governs the rights and responsibilities of individuals and organizations. It includes laws governing contracts, property, family law, and torts. Civil cases are brought by individuals or organizations against each other, and the goal is to obtain compensation for damages or to enforce a legal right.

Criminal law is the body of law that defines and punishes crimes. Crimes are offenses against the state, and they are prosecuted by the government. Criminal cases are brought by the government against individuals, and the goal is to punish the defendant and to protect society from harm.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between civil law and criminal law:

Characteristic        Civil law        Criminal law
Purpose        To resolve disputes between individuals or organizations and to obtain compensation for damages or to enforce a legal right.        To punish crimes and to protect society from harm.
Parties involved        Individuals or organizations.        The government and individuals.
Burden of proof        Preponderance of the evidence.        Beyond a reasonable doubt.
Possible outcomes        Compensation, injunction, or other remedy.        Punishment, such as imprisonment, probation, or fines.
Here are some examples of civil law cases:

A breach of contract case
A personal injury case
A divorce case
A property dispute
Here are some examples of criminal law cases:

Murder
Assault
Robbery
Theft
Drug trafficking
Civil law and criminal law are both important parts of the legal system. Civil law helps to resolve disputes and to protect the rights and interests of individuals and organizations. Criminal law helps to punish crimes and to protect society from harm.

It is important to note that there is some overlap between civil law and criminal law. For example, a person can be sued in civil court for damages caused by a crime, and a person can be both prosecuted in criminal court and sued in civil court for the same act.

If you have any questions about civil law or criminal law, you should consult with an attorney.

"Empowerment, voluntarism, and noncoercion are key dynamics of restorative justice. consensus-building. The setting is not one in which those present can be forced to contribute; they must be drawn into contributing.",0
"Restorative justice is a philosophy and approach to justice that focuses on repairing the harm caused by a crime or wrongdoing, rather than solely punishing the offender. It places a strong emphasis on healing, reconciliation, and addressing the needs of the victim, the offender, and the community. Restorative justice is based on several key principles:

Harm-Centered Approach: Restorative justice begins with recognizing that crime and wrongdoing cause harm. It prioritizes understanding the nature and extent of this harm, both to individual victims and to the broader community.

Victim-Centered: Restorative justice places the needs and interests of victims at the forefront. It seeks to empower victims by giving them a voice in the process and an opportunity to express their feelings, ask questions, and have their needs addressed.

Offender Accountability: Restorative justice holds offenders accountable for their actions. It encourages them to acknowledge their responsibility, express remorse, and take actions to repair the harm they've caused.

Community Involvement: The community plays a role in restorative justice by providing support, guidance, and a sense of collective responsibility for addressing crime and its impact. Community members can be involved as stakeholders, facilitators, or support networks for both victims and offenders.

Dialogue and Communication: Restorative justice often involves face-to-face meetings or dialogues between victims and offenders, mediated by trained facilitators. This process allows both parties to share their perspectives, ask questions, and seek mutual understanding.

Resolution and Restoration: The primary goal of restorative justice is to achieve resolution and restoration. This can include restitution to victims, community service, apology letters, or other actions taken by the offender to make amends.

Preventing Recidivism: By addressing the underlying causes of an offender's behavior and involving them in the process of repair, restorative justice aims to reduce the likelihood of reoffending.

Legal System Integration: Restorative justice programs can complement the traditional legal system. They may be used as diversion programs for certain non-violent offenses or as a component of sentencing, allowing the legal system to address both the punitive and restorative aspects of justice.

Cultural Sensitivity: Restorative justice recognizes the importance of considering cultural differences and perspectives, tailoring the process to be respectful and relevant to the parties involved.

Collaboration and Partnership: Restorative justice programs often involve collaboration between criminal justice agencies, community organizations, victim services, and other stakeholders. These partnerships help support the implementation of restorative practices.

Educational and Preventative Components: Restorative justice is not limited to post-crime processes. It can also be used in educational settings to address conflicts and prevent harm.

Restorative justice is considered an alternative to the punitive and retributive aspects of the criminal justice system. It is based on the belief that individuals who have caused harm can be held accountable and rehabilitated, and that victims can find healing and closure through dialogue, participation, and restitution. While restorative justice is not appropriate for all cases, it has gained recognition and use in various contexts as a more humane and community-oriented approach to justice.

"Restorative justice is a system of criminal justice that focuses on repairing the harm done to victims and the community at large 1. It is an approach to justice that aims to repair the harm done to victims, ensure that offenders take responsibility for their actions, understand the harm they have caused, give them an opportunity to redeem themselves, and discourage them from causing further harm 2. Restorative justice is based on a set of principles and practices that challenge the dehumanization and inequality of the traditional criminal justice system 3.

The three core elements of restorative justice are encounter, repair, and transform 4. Encounter leads to repair, and repair leads to transformation. Restorative justice programs can also complement traditional methods, and it has been argued that some cases of restorative justice constitute punishment from the perspectives of some positions on what punishment is 5.

Restorative justice is not a Ã¢â‚¬Å“one size fits allÃ¢â‚¬Â approach to crime. As such, it continues to evolve and assume new forms as governments and communities implement restorative justice principles in a manner that most effectively meets the needs of crime victims, offenders, and community residents 6.

In conclusion, restorative justice is an approach to criminal justice that focuses on repairing the harm done to victims and the community at large. It aims to ensure that offenders take responsibility for their actions, understand the harm they have caused, give them an opportunity to redeem themselves, and discourage them from causing further harm. The three core elements of restorative justice are encounter, repair, and transform.",0

Restorative justice is a philosophy of justice that focuses on the rehabilitation of offenders and the restoration of victims and the community. It is a holistic approach to justice that seeks to address the underlying causes of crime and to build relationships between victims, offenders, and the community.

Restorative justice is based on the following principles:

Crime is a violation of people and relationships, not just laws.
Victims, offenders, and the community are all affected by crime.
Justice should focus on repairing the harm caused by crime and rebuilding relationships.
All parties involved in crime should have a voice in the justice process.
Restorative justice practices can be used in a variety of settings, including schools, prisons, and the community. Some common restorative justice practices include:

Victim-offender mediation: This is a process in which victims and offenders meet with a trained facilitator to discuss the crime and its impact, and to develop a plan to repair the harm.
Community conferencing: This is a process in which victims, offenders, and community members meet to discuss the crime and its impact, and to develop a plan to repair the harm and to prevent future crime.
Family group conferencing: This is a process in which offenders and their families meet with victims and their families to discuss the crime and its impact, and to develop a plan to repair the harm.
Circle process: This is a process in which a group of people meet in a circle to discuss a topic or issue. The circle process can be used to address a variety of issues, including restorative justice.
Restorative justice has a number of benefits, including:

It reduces recidivism rates. Offenders who participate in restorative justice programs are less likely to re-offend than those who do not participate in these programs.
It helps victims to heal. Victims who participate in restorative justice programs are more likely to report feeling satisfied with the justice process and to experience closure.
It builds community. Restorative justice programs bring together victims, offenders, and community members to work together to repair the harm caused by crime and to prevent future crime.
Restorative justice is a powerful tool for addressing crime and its impact on victims, offenders, and the community. It is a holistic approach to justice that focuses on rehabilitation and restoration.

Here are some examples of how restorative justice is being used in the world:

In New Zealand, restorative justice programs are used in schools to address bullying and other forms of student misconduct.
In the United States, restorative justice programs are used in prisons to help offenders rehabilitate and to prepare for their release back into the community.
In South Africa, restorative justice programs are used to help victims of apartheid heal and to build a more just society.
Restorative justice is an evolving field, but it is gaining momentum around the world. As more and more people become aware of the benefits of restorative justice, it is likely that we will see more and more restorative justice programs being implemented in a variety of settings.",0
"The Declaration and two of the core human rights treaties -- the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights -- are sometimes referred to collectively as the International Bill of Rights.",0
"There are several major international human rights treaties and agreements that establish a framework for the protection and promotion of human rights at the global level. These treaties are adopted and monitored by various international organizations, including the United Nations. Some of the key international human rights treaties include:

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): Although not a legally binding treaty, the UDHR, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, is a foundational document in the field of human rights.

"The Charter of the United Nations specifically calls on the Organization to help in the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means, including arbitration and judicial settlement (Article 33), and to encourage the progressive development of international law and its codification (Article 13).",0
"The United Nations (UN) plays a central role in the development, promotion, and enforcement of international law. Its role in international law encompasses several key functions and responsibilities:

Codification and Development of International Law: The UN serves as a forum for the codification and progressive development of international law. This involves clarifying and formalizing the rules and principles governing the conduct of states and other international actors. The International Law Commission (ILC) is a subsidiary organ of the UN that plays a significant role in this process.

Treaty Negotiation and Adoption: The UN provides a platform for states to negotiate and adopt international treaties and agreements. These treaties cover a wide range of issues, from human rights and the environment to disarmament and trade. The UN also hosts treaty secretariats to support the implementation of various international agreements.

Peace and Security: The UN plays a central role in the maintenance of international peace and security. The UN Security Council has the authority to make binding decisions on member states to address threats to peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression. This includes authorizing the use of force under certain circumstances.

Human Rights Protection: The UN is a key player in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide. It has established various human rights treaties and bodies, such as the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to monitor and advance the protection of human rights.

International Justice: The UN supports international judicial mechanisms, including the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), which address disputes between states and prosecute individuals for international crimes such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

Arbitration and Mediation: The UN offers its services for the peaceful resolution of international disputes through mechanisms like the International Court of Arbitration and the Office of the UN Ombudsperson for Counter-Terrorism.

International Environmental Law: The UN addresses global environmental challenges through conventions and agreements, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These agreements aim to protect the environment and promote sustainable development.

Development of Customary International Law: UN practice and resolutions can contribute to the formation of customary international law. The persistent state practice and opinio juris (belief that a practice is legally required) of UN member states can shape the development of customary law.

Peacekeeping Operations: The UN deploys peacekeeping missions to help countries in conflict achieve stability and security. These missions are often authorized by the Security Council and operate in accordance with international law, including the principles of consent, impartiality, and the use of force only in self-defense.

Diplomacy and Conflict Prevention: The UN engages in diplomacy and conflict prevention efforts to resolve international disputes through peaceful means, such as negotiation and mediation.

Promotion of International Cooperation: The UN promotes cooperation among states in various fields, including trade, health, education, and cultural exchange. International law governs these cooperative efforts and facilitates interactions between countries.

Humanitarian Law: The UN supports the implementation of international humanitarian law (the laws of armed conflict) to protect civilians and combatants during armed conflicts.

The UN also has a specialized legal body, the Office of Legal Affairs, responsible for providing legal advice and assistance to the UN organs and specialized agencies and for the codification and development of international law.

The United Nations (UN) plays a vital role in the development and enforcement of international law. The UN Charter, the founding document of the UN, sets out a number of principles and objectives that are based on international law, including the maintenance of international peace and security, the promotion of economic and social development, and the protection of human rights.

The UN has established a number of bodies and mechanisms to promote and protect international law. These include the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial organ of the UN, which settles legal disputes between states; the International Law Commission (ILC), which works to codify and develop international law; and the UN Office of Legal Affairs, which provides legal advice and assistance to UN organs and agencies.

The UN also plays an important role in the development of new international law. It has adopted a number of treaties and conventions on a wide range of issues, including human rights, environmental protection, and international trade. These treaties and conventions set out binding rules of conduct for states and other actors.

The UN also has a number of specialized agencies that work to promote and protect international law in their respective areas of expertise. These agencies include the International Labour Organization (ILO), which works to promote international labor standards and social justice; the World Health Organization (WHO), which works to improve global health; and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which works to promote education, science, and culture.

The UN plays a vital role in the development and enforcement of international law. Through its organs, agencies, and specialized agencies, the UN works to promote and protect the rights of individuals, states, and other actors.

The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Great WritÃ¢â‚¬Â of habeas corpus is a fundamental right in the Constitution that protects against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment. Translated from Latin it means Ã¢â‚¬Å“show me the body.Ã¢â‚¬Â Habeas corpus has historically been an important instrument to safeguard individual freedom against arbitrary executive power.,0
"Habeas corpus is a fundamental legal principle and legal remedy that safeguards an individual's right to be free from unlawful detention or imprisonment. The term ""habeas corpus"" is Latin and translates to ""you shall have the body."" The writ of habeas corpus is a legal order that requires a person who is detaining another individual to bring the detainee before a court or judge and provide a legal justification for the detention. This legal procedure ensures that a person's liberty is not unlawfully deprived by the government or any other entity.

Key aspects of habeas corpus include:

Preventing Unlawful Detention: Habeas corpus is a critical mechanism for protecting individuals from arbitrary or unlawful detention by the government or other authorities. It is a check on state power and ensures that no one can be held in custody without a legitimate legal basis.

Judicial Review: When a writ of habeas corpus is filed, a court or judge reviews the circumstances of the detention to determine whether it is lawful. This includes assessing whether the person is being held in accordance with the law, with proper legal procedures and justifications.

Due Process: Habeas corpus is closely tied to the principle of due process, which guarantees individuals a fair and just legal process. If someone is detained, they have the right to challenge the detention and have their case heard in a court of law.

Protection of Civil Liberties: Habeas corpus is considered a fundamental civil liberty and a cornerstone of democratic legal systems. It is a safeguard against wrongful imprisonment and an important tool for protecting individual rights and freedoms.

Historical Significance: The writ of habeas corpus has a long history dating back to medieval England. It was formalized in the English legal system through the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679. In the United States, the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, in Article I, Section 9, which states that ""The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.""

Suspension in Extraordinary Circumstances: Although the right to habeas corpus is fundamental, it is not absolute. In times of rebellion, invasion, or other extreme circumstances, a government may temporarily suspend the writ of habeas corpus. Such suspensions are rare and are typically subject to judicial review to ensure they are not abused.

Habeas corpus is a crucial legal remedy that helps protect individual freedoms and ensures that individuals are not subject to arbitrary detention. It is a key element of the rule of law and a fundamental principle of democratic societies, providing a legal avenue for individuals to challenge their detention when they believe their rights have been violated.",0
"Habeas corpus is a legal term that refers to a writ (a court order) that requires a person who is being detained or imprisoned to be brought before a judge or court 1. The purpose of the writ is to ensure that the detention is lawful and that the person is not being held without sufficient cause 1. The writ of habeas corpus is an important safeguard against arbitrary detention and is considered a fundamental right in many countries 1.

The phrase Ã¢â‚¬Å“habeas corpusÃ¢â‚¬Â comes from Latin and means Ã¢â‚¬Å“you shall have the bodyÃ¢â‚¬Â 2. The writ of habeas corpus has been used for centuries to protect individual liberties and prevent abuses of power by the government 2. In the United States, the writ of habeas corpus is protected by the Constitution and can only be suspended in cases of rebellion or invasion 2.

In conclusion, habeas corpus is a legal term that refers to a writ that requires a person who is being detained or imprisoned to be brought before a judge or court. It is an important safeguard against arbitrary detention and is considered a fundamental right in many countries.",0
"
Habeas corpus is a legal proceeding in which a person who is being detained can request that a court determine whether the detention is lawful. The name is Latin for ""you have the body"" and is meant to emphasize that the person being detained must be brought before the court so that the court can assess the legality of the detention.

The writ of habeas corpus is one of the oldest and most important legal rights in the world. It is a fundamental right in many countries, including the United States, where it is guaranteed in the Constitution.

There are a number of reasons why habeas corpus is important. First, it protects people from being detained without due process of law. Second, it allows people to challenge the legality of their detention before a court of law. Third, it helps to ensure that the government does not abuse its power to detain people.

Habeas corpus is used in a variety of situations. For example, it can be used by people who have been arrested and are waiting trial, by people who are being held in immigration detention, and by people who are being held in mental health institutions.

Here are some examples of how habeas corpus has been used in the United States:

In the 1960s, habeas corpus was used to challenge the detention of civil rights activists who were arrested for protesting segregation.
In the 1970s, habeas corpus was used to challenge the detention of American soldiers who were being held as prisoners of war in Vietnam.
In the 1990s, habeas corpus was used to challenge the detention of immigrants who were being held in indefinite detention without charge.
In the 2000s, habeas corpus was used to challenge the detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.
Habeas corpus is a powerful tool for protecting the rights of individuals and for ensuring that the government does not abuse its power. It is a fundamental right that is essential for a free and just society.

If you are being detained and you believe that your detention is unlawful, you should contact an attorney to discuss your options for filing a habeas corpus petition.",0
"With a considerable influence on national and international legislators, courts, public administrators and private companies, environmental principles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as the polluter-pays principle, sustainable development or the precautionary principle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ play an important role in the making, application and the interpretation ...",0
"Environmental law encompasses a body of legal principles and regulations designed to protect and preserve the environment and natural resources. These laws aim to address various environmental challenges, such as pollution, conservation, and sustainable development. Some of the key principles of environmental law include:

Precautionary Principle: This principle emphasizes taking preventive action to avoid environmental harm, even when scientific evidence is not conclusive. It places the burden of proof on those who propose or undertake potentially harmful activities.

Polluter Pays Principle: Under this principle, those who cause pollution or environmental damage are responsible for bearing the costs of remediation and cleanup. It encourages accountability for the negative environmental impacts of one's actions.

Sustainable Development: Environmental law often seeks to balance the needs of the present with the needs of future generations. It promotes sustainable development that meets current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Integration Principle: Environmental law should be integrated into other areas of law and decision-making processes, such as urban planning, land use, and economic development. This ensures that environmental considerations are taken into account across various sectors.

Public Participation: Many environmental laws provide for public participation in decision-making processes, allowing citizens to voice their concerns, offer input, and participate in environmental impact assessments and permitting procedures.

Access to Information: This principle ensures that individuals and organizations have access to information related to the environment and the activities that may impact it. Access to information empowers the public to make informed decisions and hold governments and organizations accountable.

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Before undertaking certain projects or activities with potential environmental impacts, an environmental impact assessment is often required. It helps identify and mitigate potential harm to the environment.

Conservation and Biodiversity: Environmental law promotes the conservation of biodiversity and the protection of endangered species and their habitats. It may include designating protected areas and regulating activities in these areas.

Transboundary Cooperation: Environmental issues often cross borders, requiring international cooperation and treaties to address common challenges. The principle of international cooperation emphasizes coordination among nations to address environmental problems.

Common Heritage of Mankind: Some natural resources, such as the deep seabed or outer space, are considered the common heritage of mankind. International agreements and treaties aim to regulate the use and exploitation of such resources for the benefit of all.

National Sovereignty and Shared Responsibility: While nations have sovereignty over their own territories, they also share a responsibility for protecting the global environment. This principle underscores the idea that environmental issues are interconnected and require international collaboration.

Adaptive Management: Environmental law recognizes the dynamic nature of ecosystems and encourages adaptive management approaches. This involves monitoring and adjusting management strategies based on ongoing assessments of environmental conditions and outcomes.

Enforcement and Compliance: Effective environmental law includes mechanisms for enforcement and compliance, which may involve penalties, fines, and legal actions against individuals or entities that violate environmental regulations.

These principles guide the development and implementation of environmental law at the national and international levels. They provide a framework for addressing environmental challenges while balancing the needs of society, the economy, and the natural world.

"The Magna Carta (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Great CharterÃ¢â‚¬Â) is a document guaranteeing English political liberties that was drafted at Runnymede, a meadow by the River Thames, and signed by King John on June 15, 1215, under pressure from his rebellious barons.
",0
"The Magna Carta, Latin for ""Great Charter,"" is a foundational legal document in the history of constitutional law and human rights. It was first issued in 1215 during the reign of King John of England and has a rich and complex history. The Magna Carta's historical development can be summarized in the following key stages:

Background and Early Grievances:

King John, who ruled England from 1199 to 1216, faced numerous challenges during his reign, including conflicts with barons, disputes with the Church, and heavy taxation.
Many of his actions, such as levying heavy taxes without the consent of his barons and abusing his royal powers, led to growing discontent among the nobility.
The Rebellion of the Barons:

In 1214, King John's military campaign in France ended in defeat, which further strained his relationship with the barons.
In response to his oppressive rule and financial demands, a group of barons, led by Robert Fitzwalter, rose in rebellion against the king.
The Sealing of the Magna Carta (June 15, 1215):

On June 15, 1215, at Runnymede, a meadow by the River Thames, King John met with the rebel barons to negotiate a settlement.
The result of these negotiations was the sealing of the Magna Carta, a document that limited the king's powers and established a framework of rights and legal principles.
Key Provisions of the Magna Carta:

The Magna Carta contained a series of clauses that addressed various grievances and established principles that limited the king's authority. Some key provisions included:
Protection against arbitrary imprisonment.
Limits on taxation without consent.
Recognition of the right to a fair trial.
Protection of Church rights.
Establishment of a council of barons to oversee the king's actions.
Reinterpretation and Reissues:

King John and the barons soon disputed the terms of the Magna Carta, leading to further conflict.
Over the years, the Magna Carta was reissued and revised, with later monarchs making alterations to its text. The document evolved to address changing circumstances.
Recognition as a Fundamental Law:

The Magna Carta gradually came to be seen as a fundamental law, which the king was expected to uphold. It served as a basis for the idea of the rule of law and limited government.
Legacy and Influence:

The Magna Carta had a profound influence on the development of constitutional and legal principles, not only in England but also in other parts of the world. It is often seen as an early precursor to concepts of individual rights and limitations on government power.
Reaffirmation in Later Centuries:

The principles of the Magna Carta were reaffirmed and celebrated in various historical documents and events. It played a role in the development of the English Bill of Rights in 1689 and influenced the drafting of the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Modern Significance:

The Magna Carta is celebrated as a symbol of liberty, the rule of law, and the protection of individual rights. It continues to be a touchstone for discussions of legal and constitutional principles.
While the Magna Carta did not bring about an immediate end to abuses of power, it remains a seminal document in the history of constitutionalism and the protection of individual liberties, with its principles deeply embedded in the legal and political traditions of many countries.",0
"The Magna Carta was a charter of rights that limited the power of the king and established the rule of law and individual liberties in England 1. It was signed by King John on June 15, 1215, under threat of civil war from his rebellious barons 1. The Magna Carta was reissued, with alterations, in 1216, 1217, and 1225 1. The Magna Carta provided the foundation for individual rights in Anglo-American jurisprudence 2.

The Magna Carta was written by a group of barons to protect their rights and property against a tyrannical king 3. It was concerned with many practical matters and specific grievances relevant to the feudal system under which they lived 3. The Magna Carta was not initially successful, but it was reissued (with alterations) in 1216, 1217, and 1225, and eventually served as the foundation for the English system of common law 4.

Later generations of Englishmen celebrated the Magna Carta as a symbol of freedom from oppression, as would the Founding Fathers of the United States of America, who in 1776 looked to the charter as a historical precedent for asserting their liberty from the English crown 4.",0

Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to Ã¢â‚¬Å“learnÃ¢â‚¬Â information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases.,0
"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. The process of how machine learning works can be summarized in the following steps:

Data Collection: The first step in machine learning is collecting relevant data. This data can come from various sources, such as databases, sensors, websites, or other data sources. The quality and quantity of data play a crucial role in the success of machine learning models.

Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Raw data often contains errors, missing values, or inconsistencies. Data cleaning involves identifying and addressing these issues to ensure the data is accurate and reliable.
Feature Engineering: This step involves selecting, transforming, or creating features (variables) from the data that are most relevant for the machine learning task. It can include data scaling, one-hot encoding, and feature selection.
Data Splitting:

The dataset is typically split into two or more subsets: a training set and a testing set (and sometimes a validation set). The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose a machine learning algorithm or model that is suitable for the specific task. Common machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, among others.
The selected model is trained on the training dataset by feeding it the input data along with the corresponding correct outputs (labels or target values). During training, the model learns to make predictions by adjusting its internal parameters or weights based on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

After training, the model's performance is assessed using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error, and others, depending on the type of machine learning task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
Model performance is crucial in determining whether the model is ready for deployment or requires further refinement.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Many machine learning models have hyperparameters that control aspects of the learning process, such as the learning rate or the complexity of the model. Hyperparameter tuning involves finding the best combination of hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
Model Deployment:

If the model performs well in the testing phase, it can be deployed for real-world use. Deployment involves integrating the model into an application, system, or platform, so it can make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen data.
Model Monitoring and Maintenance:

After deployment, it's important to continuously monitor the model's performance to ensure it remains accurate and reliable. Models may need periodic updates or retraining with new data to adapt to changing circumstances.
Inference and Prediction:

Once deployed, the model can make predictions or inferences based on new data. This can include tasks like classifying images, making recommendations, detecting anomalies, and more, depending on the model's purpose.
Machine learning models are particularly valuable when dealing with complex patterns or large datasets, as they can automatically learn and adapt from data, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. The specific techniques and algorithms used in machine learning can vary widely, depending on the problem to be solved and the type of data available.

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

There are three main types of machine learning algorithms:

Supervised learning: Supervised learning algorithms are trained on a set of labeled data, where each input has a known output. The algorithm learns from this data to predict the output for new inputs.
Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained on a set of unlabeled data, where the outputs are unknown. The algorithm learns from this data to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by trial and error. The algorithm is rewarded for taking actions that lead to desired outcomes and penalized for taking actions that lead to undesired outcomes.
Machine learning is used in a variety of applications, including:

Spam filtering: ML algorithms are used to identify and filter out spam emails.
Product recommendations: ML algorithms are used to recommend products to customers based on their past purchase history and browsing behavior.
Fraud detection: ML algorithms are used to detect fraudulent transactions.
Medical diagnosis: ML algorithms are used to help doctors diagnose diseases and predict patient outcomes.
Natural language processing: ML algorithms are used to process and understand human language, such as in the development of chatbots and translation software.
Image recognition: ML algorithms are used to recognize objects and faces in images and videos.
Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide range of problems. As machine learning algorithms continue to improve, we can expect to see even more innovative and groundbreaking applications of machine learning in the future.

Here is an example of how a supervised learning algorithm might be used:

An online retailer wants to develop a system to recommend products to customers. The retailer has a dataset of customer purchase history. The retailer can use this dataset to train a supervised learning algorithm. The algorithm will learn from this data to identify patterns and relationships in the data. For example, the algorithm might learn that customers who buy diapers are also likely to buy baby wipes.

Once the algorithm is trained, the retailer can use it to recommend products to new customers. For example, if a new customer visits the retailer's website and views a product page for diapers, the retailer can use the algorithm to recommend baby wipes to the customer.

Supervised learning is just one type of machine learning algorithm. There are many other types of machine learning algorithms that can be used to solve a variety of problems.",0

"Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on artificial neural networks with multiple layers, also known as deep neural networks. These networks are designed to automatically learn and represent data in increasingly abstract and hierarchical ways. The ""deep"" in deep learning refers to the depth of the neural network, which consists of multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. The concept of deep learning can be understood through the following key points:

Neural Networks: Deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, which are inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons. These networks consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, organized into layers.

Deep Architectures: Deep learning models are characterized by having multiple hidden layers, often referred to as the hidden layers of a deep neural network. Each hidden layer contains a set of neurons that process and transform the data.

Feature Learning: Deep learning excels in feature learning, where the neural network automatically discovers relevant features or representations of the input data as it passes through the layers. This ability to learn complex hierarchical features is a key strength of deep learning.

Training with Backpropagation: Deep neural networks are trained using an optimization technique called backpropagation. During training, the network makes predictions, and the error between the predicted and actual outputs is propagated backward through the network to adjust the model's internal parameters (weights and biases). This process is repeated iteratively to minimize the error.

Unsupervised and Supervised Learning: Deep learning models can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. In supervised learning, the network is trained with labeled data to predict specific outputs (e.g., image classification). In unsupervised learning, the network learns to find patterns and representations in data without specific labels (e.g., clustering or dimensionality reduction).

Popular Architectures:

Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs): These are the simplest form of deep neural networks, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Designed for image and spatial data, CNNs use convolutional layers to detect patterns and hierarchies of features in images.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Suited for sequential data, RNNs have recurrent connections that enable them to maintain memory of previous inputs.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): These are specialized RNN architectures with improved ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.
Transformer: Introduced in natural language processing (NLP), the Transformer architecture has revolutionized NLP tasks with self-attention mechanisms.
Applications: Deep learning has found applications in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, recommendation systems, healthcare, finance, and many others. It has enabled breakthroughs in image and speech recognition, language translation, autonomous vehicles, and more.

Data-Driven Approach: Deep learning relies on large datasets and the computational power of modern hardware, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs). The data-driven nature of deep learning allows it to excel at capturing complex patterns and making predictions from diverse data sources.

Deep learning has gained significant popularity and made remarkable advancements in recent years due to its exceptional performance in various tasks and its ability to handle large-scale, high-dimensional data. It has played a pivotal role in the development of many AI applications and continues to be an active area of research and innovation.

Technological Enhancement: Transhumanists advocate for the use of advanced technologies to augment human capabilities. This includes technologies like genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and nanotechnology.

Post-Humanism: Transhumanists often envision a future in which humans evolve into a new form, often referred to as ""post-humans."" These post-humans would have augmented intellectual, physical, and emotional capacities beyond those of contemporary humans.

Individual Autonomy: Transhumanism places a strong emphasis on individual autonomy and the right to choose how one enhances their own body and mind. This includes the right to use technologies like cognitive enhancers, life extension treatments, and cybernetic enhancements.

Ethical Considerations: While transhumanism promotes enhancement, it also acknowledges the importance of ethical considerations. Transhumanists argue that responsible use of technology should be guided by ethical principles to avoid unintended consequences and harm.

Anti-Aging and Life Extension: A significant focus of transhumanism is on extending human lifespan and mitigating the effects of aging. This involves research into longevity and regenerative medicine.

Singularitarianism: Some transhumanists embrace the idea of the Singularity, a hypothetical point in the future where technological growth becomes uncontrollable, leading to profound changes in human society and existence.

Open Source Information: Transhumanism often supports the open sharing of scientific and technological information to accelerate progress and avoid the concentration of power and knowledge.

Post-Gender and Post-Race: Transhumanism can extend to discussions about the potential dissolution of traditional concepts of gender and race as humans modify their bodies and identities.

Existential Risks: Transhumanists are concerned about existential risks to humanity, such as pandemics, asteroid impacts, or the misuse of powerful technologies, and they advocate for measures to mitigate these risks.

Human Enhancement for All: Transhumanists generally advocate for broad access to enhancements, not limited to the privileged few, to reduce social and economic disparities.

Transhumanism is a diverse movement with varying degrees of optimism about the possibilities and the extent to which humans can transcend their natural limitations. Critics often raise ethical concerns about the potential consequences of unfettered technological enhancement, such as the exacerbation of social inequalities, the loss of human identity, and the misuse of powerful technologies. Proponents, on the other hand, see transhumanism as a path to a brighter and more advanced future for humanity. The movement continues to evolve and remains a subject of philosophical debate and exploration.

"Transhumanism is a philosophical and intellectual movement that aims to improve the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies that can greatly enhance longevity, cognition, and other aspects of human capabilities 1. The movement also explores the potential benefits, dangers, and ethics of such technologies. Transhumanism considers the possibility of transcending the current human form and limitations by means of science and technology. It may involve artificial intelligence, prosthetic body parts, and genetic manipulation 1.

The essence of transhumanism is that Ã¢â‚¬Å“the human species in its current form does not represent the end of our development but rather a comparatively early phaseÃ¢â‚¬Â 2. The movement envisions a future in which the responsible application of such technologies enables humans to slow, reverse, or eliminate the aging process, to achieve corresponding increases in human life spans, and to enhance human cognitive and sensory capacities 3. The movement proposes that humans with augmented capabilities will evolve into an enhanced species that transcends humanityÃ¢â‚¬â€the Ã¢â‚¬Å“posthumanÃ¢â‚¬Â 3.

The ethical principles for data privacy and AI include transparency, fairness, accuracy, privacy, do no harm/protect and promote human rights, have a defined purpose, necessity, and proportionality, prioritize safety and security with risks identified, be built on fairness and non-discrimination, be sustainable (socially and environmentally), guarantee human oversight & not impinge on the autonomy, be transparent and explainable 1",0

Transhumanism is a philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology.

Transhumanists strive to transcend the limitations of the human body and mind. They believe that humans can achieve a posthuman state, in which they are no longer limited by their biological constraints. This state could involve the enhancement of human intelligence, physical capabilities, and lifespan.

Transhumanists believe that these enhancements could be achieved through a variety of technologies, including artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, biotechnology, and cognitive science. They believe that these technologies have the potential to revolutionize human life and society.

Some of the specific goals of transhumanists include:

Increasing human intelligence and cognitive abilities
Extending human lifespan
Enhancing human physical capabilities
Eliminating disease and suffering
Creating new forms of art and culture
Exploring the universe
Transhumanism is a controversial movement, and there are many who disagree with its goals and methods. Some critics argue that transhumanism is unethical and that it could lead to the creation of a new class of superhumans who are superior to ordinary humans. Others argue that transhumanism is unrealistic and that it is unlikely that we will ever be able to achieve the posthuman state.

Despite the controversy, transhumanism is a growing movement, and it is attracting the attention of scientists, philosophers, and policymakers alike. It is possible that transhumanists will one day achieve their goals of transforming the human condition.

Here are some specific examples of technologies that transhumanists are interested in:

Artificial intelligence: Transhumanists believe that AI could be used to enhance human intelligence in a variety of ways. For example, AI could be used to develop brain-computer interfaces that would allow humans to communicate directly with machines. AI could also be used to develop new educational tools that would help people learn more effectively.
Nanotechnology: Transhumanists believe that nanotechnology could be used to repair and enhance the human body. For example, nanobots could be used to deliver drugs directly to cells or to repair damaged tissue.
Biotechnology: Transhumanists believe that biotechnology could be used to extend human lifespan and to enhance human physical capabilities. For example, gene editing could be used to eliminate genetic diseases or to improve athletic performance.
Cognitive science: Transhumanists believe that cognitive science could be used to improve human reasoning and decision-making skills. For example, cognitive science could be used to develop new training programs that would help people think more clearly and make better decisions.
It is important to note that transhumanism is still a relatively new movement, and many of the technologies that transhumanists are interested in are still in their early stages of development. However, transhumanism is a growing movement, and it is likely to have a significant impact on the future of humanity.",0
"A singularity in technology would be a situation where computer programs become so advanced that AI transcends human intelligence, potentially erasing the boundary between humanity and computers.",0
"The concept of the Singularity in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a hypothetical point in the future when technological progress accelerates to such an extent that it leads to profound and potentially unpredictable changes in human society and existence. The term ""Singularity"" is often associated with the ideas of futurist Ray Kurzweil and mathematician and computer scientist Vernor Vinge. There are a few key aspects to consider:

Exponential Technological Growth: The Singularity is based on the idea that the rate of technological progress, particularly in AI and related fields, is exponential. This means that advancements build upon one another, leading to increasingly rapid and transformative changes.

Human-AI Convergence: At the Singularity, it is theorized that there will be a merging or convergence between humans and AI. This could involve human-machine interfaces, brain-computer interfaces, or the creation of highly intelligent AI systems that surpass human capabilities.

Unpredictable Outcomes: The Singularity is often associated with the notion that once this point is reached, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to predict the consequences and developments that follow. It may usher in a period of rapid and radical change that is beyond current human understanding.

Superintelligent AI: A key component of Singularity discussions is the creation of superintelligent AI systems that surpass human intelligence and are capable of recursive self-improvement. These AIs could rapidly improve their own capabilities, leading to an intelligence explosion.

Existential Risks and Benefits: Discussions about the Singularity often revolve around the potential for existential risks, such as the misuse of superintelligent AI, but also the potential for enormous benefits, including the resolution of major global challenges and the achievement of post-scarcity societies.

Debate and Speculation: The concept of the Singularity is highly speculative and has generated significant debate. While some technologists and futurists embrace the idea, others are more cautious and emphasize the need for careful ethical and safety considerations in AI development.

It's important to note that the Singularity is a controversial concept and a matter of speculation, and there is no consensus among experts about whether or when it might occur. Some argue that it's a mischaracterization of the potential future of AI, while others view it as a serious concern to be addressed.

Many discussions about the Singularity center on the need for ethical and safety considerations in AI development, including the development of robust control mechanisms for superintelligent AI and responsible governance to mitigate risks and ensure positive outcomes.",0
"The singularity in AI is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for human civilization 1. The concept is based on the idea that artificial intelligence will eventually surpass human intelligence, leading to a rapid transformation of society 2.

The term Ã¢â‚¬Å“singularityÃ¢â‚¬Â borrows terminology from black hole physics, as it describes a point beyond which it is impossible to predict what will happen 2. Some experts believe that the singularity could occur within the next few decades, while others believe it is still centuries away 3.

One metric used to measure progress towards the singularity is the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can 2. However, AGI is still a long way off, and there are many technical and ethical challenges that must be overcome before it can be achieved 3.

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to note that the singularity is a hypothetical concept, and there is no consensus among experts about whether or when it will occur. While some experts believe that the singularity could lead to a utopian future in which humans and machines coexist in harmony, others warn of the potential dangers of such a future 3",0
"
The singularity is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for human civilization. The term was coined by mathematician and futurist Vernor Vinge in 1993.

Vinge argued that the singularity would be triggered by the development of artificial intelligence (AI) that is more intelligent than humans. This AI would be able to design and build even more intelligent AI, leading to an intelligence explosion. Vinge believed that the singularity would occur between 2005 and 2030.

Other experts have offered different estimates for when the singularity might occur, but most agree that it is a real possibility. Some experts believe that the singularity could be beneficial, leading to a utopian future where humans are freed from the need to work and can pursue their passions. Others believe that the singularity could be harmful, leading to a dystopian future where humans are enslaved by AI or even wiped out.

It is impossible to say for sure what will happen at the singularity. However, it is clear that AI is becoming increasingly intelligent and powerful. This raises important questions about the future of humanity and our relationship with AI.

Here are some of the potential benefits and risks of the singularity:

Potential benefits:

AI could solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change, poverty, and disease.
AI could create new opportunities for human creativity and expression.
AI could help us to better understand ourselves and the universe around us.
Potential risks:

AI could become so intelligent that it surpasses human control.
AI could be used to create autonomous weapons systems that could kill without human intervention.
AI could be used to manipulate and control people.
It is important to start thinking about the potential benefits and risks of the singularity now, so that we can be prepared for whatever the future may hold.",0

"Climate change is primarily driven by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat and lead to an increase in global temperatures, resulting in the various effects associated with climate change. The main causes of climate change include:

Burning of Fossil Fuels: The combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, for energy production is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. This includes emissions from power plants, transportation (cars, trucks, airplanes), and industrial processes.

Deforestation: The clearing of forests for agriculture, urban development, and other purposes reduces the planet's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) through the process of photosynthesis. It also releases stored carbon in trees and plants back into the atmosphere.

Agriculture: Agricultural activities, particularly livestock farming, produce methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas. The use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture also releases nitrous oxide (N2O), another potent greenhouse gas.

Land Use Changes: Changes in land use, including urbanization, wetland drainage, and conversion of natural landscapes, can alter the balance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Industrial Processes: Certain industrial processes release potent greenhouse gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), which have a much greater heat-trapping capacity than CO2.

Waste Management: The decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane, which is released into the atmosphere if not captured and controlled.

Use of Refrigerants: Refrigerants used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems, including HFCs and PFCs, can escape into the atmosphere and contribute to warming.

Transportation: The transport sector is a significant contributor to climate change, primarily through the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in vehicles and the release of CO2.

Livestock and Agriculture: Agriculture, particularly livestock farming, produces methane and nitrous oxide emissions, both of which are potent greenhouse gases.

Waste and Landfills: Organic waste decomposition in landfills generates methane emissions if not properly managed.

Natural Processes: While human activities are the primary driver of climate change, natural processes like volcanic eruptions and variations in solar radiation can influence the climate as well. However, these natural factors are currently not the main cause of the observed global warming.

Warming Feedback Loops: As the Earth warms, it triggers feedback mechanisms that can amplify the warming. For example, the melting of polar ice reduces the Earth's reflectivity (albedo), causing more heat to be absorbed rather than reflected, which further warms the planet.

It's important to note that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are the primary drivers of recent and rapid climate change. The accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to global warming, resulting in rising global temperatures, more frequent and severe weather events, sea-level rise, and other adverse impacts on the environment and human societies. Addressing climate change requires global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources and practices.

Climate change can overwhelm the capacity of ecosystems to mitigate extreme events and disturbance, such as wildfires, floods, and drought",0
"Climate change has a profound impact on ecosystems and wildlife, leading to a range of ecological disruptions and challenges. The consequences of climate change for ecosystems and wildlife are extensive and include:

Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:

Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can lead to shifts in the geographical distribution of habitats. Many species are forced to migrate to find suitable conditions, but the fragmentation of ecosystems and human development can create barriers to movement, limiting their ability to adapt.
Altered Migration Patterns:

Climate change can affect the timing and routes of animal migrations. For some species, these changes can lead to mismatches with the availability of food sources, affecting their survival and reproduction.
Changing Breeding Seasons:

Rising temperatures can lead to altered breeding seasons for wildlife. Changes in temperature can influence the availability of food and nesting sites, impacting the success of reproduction.
Ocean Acidification:

Increased atmospheric CO2 levels also lead to higher CO2 levels in the ocean, causing ocean acidification. This affects marine ecosystems and can harm coral reefs, shellfish, and other marine organisms.
Loss of Polar Habitats:

Rapid warming in polar regions is causing the melting of ice, which impacts species like polar bears, penguins, seals, and various marine life that depend on these habitats for breeding, foraging, and protection.
Shifts in Species Distribution:

As temperatures rise, many species are moving to higher latitudes or elevations in search of cooler conditions. This can lead to competition with local species, the introduction of invasive species, and changes in local biodiversity.
Loss of Biodiversity:

Ecosystem disruptions, such as habitat loss and species migration, can lead to a loss of biodiversity. Many species are at risk of extinction due to these disruptions.
Altered Food Chains and Ecosystem Dynamics:

Climate change can affect the timing and distribution of food sources, disrupting predator-prey relationships and altering the dynamics of ecosystems.
Extreme Weather Events:

More frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, can destroy habitats, disrupt ecosystems, and directly harm wildlife populations.
Disease Spread:

Warmer temperatures can lead to the expansion of disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes and ticks), increasing the transmission of diseases to wildlife populations.
Changes in Plant Phenology:

Changes in temperature and precipitation can affect the timing of plant flowering and fruiting, impacting the availability of food for herbivores and pollinators.
Ocean Warming and Coral Bleaching:

Warming oceans can lead to coral bleaching events, which are detrimental to coral reefs and the marine species that depend on them for food and shelter.
Loss of Glacier Habitats:

Glaciers are retreating due to climate change, impacting species that rely on glacier-fed streams and meltwater for survival.
Shifts in Ocean Currents and Upwelling:

Climate change can alter ocean currents and upwelling patterns, affecting marine ecosystems and the distribution of species like fish.
Efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts are critical to protecting ecosystems and wildlife. Conservation measures, sustainable land management, and the establishment of protected areas are among the strategies used to help preserve biodiversity and reduce the adverse effects of climate change on the natural world. It is important to recognize that climate change is a global issue with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, wildlife, and human societies, and addressing it requires international cooperation and collective act",0
"Climate change affects ecosystems and wildlife in many ways. As habitats experience different temperatures, precipitation patterns, and other changes, the organisms that make up ecosystems feel the effects 1. Here are some of the impacts of climate change on ecosystems and wildlife:

Reduced ecosystem services: Climate change can reduce the ability of ecosystems to provide services such as lumber, erosion control, and habitat for wildlife 1.

Changes in populationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ability to survive: Climate change can affect the ability of some species to survive. For example, earlier snowmelts are making the white coat of the snowshoe hare stand out more against the brown forest floor, increasing its vulnerability to predators 1.

Increased spread of invasive species: Climate change can increase the spread of invasive species such as cheatgrass, which threatens ranches in the western United States by degrading soil nutrients and leading to a loss of biodiversity 1.

Changes in the timing of natural events: Climate change can alter the timing of natural events such as salmon runs in Alaska. Brown bears are switching their diet from salmon to elderberries as the berries ripen earlier due to a warming climate. When bears eat less salmon, it also affects other animals in the food web, like birds that feed on the salmon carcasses bears leave behind 1.

Destabilization of ecosystems: Rising temperatures risk destabilizing the balance between wildlife and their ecosystem. As plants adapt to changing warming patterns, usually by blooming earlier or shifting to cooler locations, the wildlife that has adapted to them will be forced to face new environments 2.",0

"Renewable energy is one of the most effective tools we have in the fight against climate change 1. The burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause the planet to warm up 1. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power do not produce greenhouse gases and are therefore much less harmful to the environment 1.

Renewable energy can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance energy security, stimulate economic growth, and create sustainable jobs 2. Wind and solar energy have experienced remarkable growth and huge cost improvements over the past decade with no signs of slowing down. Prices are declining rapidly, and renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels all around the country. In some places, new renewable energy is already cheaper than continuing to operate old, inefficient and dirty fossil fuel-fired or nuclear power plants 1.

In addition to the climate benefits that they will help deliver, renewables already provide a wide range of market and public health benefits that far outweigh their costs. A recent report from the Department of Energy and Lawrence Berkeley National (LBNL) Laboratory found that renewable portfolio standardsÃ¢â‚¬â€state policies that mandate that a specific amount of the stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electricity comes from renewablesÃ¢â‚¬â€provide a wide range of economic, health, and climate benefits. The report concluded that in 2013 alone, renewable standards across the country saved customers up to $1.2 billion from reduced wholesale electric prices and $1.3 billion to $3.7 billion from lower natural gas prices (as a result of lower demand for natural gas across the power sector) 1.",0

The transition to renewable energy is essential for combating climate change. By switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create a more sustainable future for all.",0
"The major physical impacts of a rise in sea level include erosion of beaches, inundation of deltas as well as flooding and loss of many marshes and wetlands. Increased salinity will likely become a problem in coastal aquifers and estuarine systems as a result of saltwater intrusion.",0
"Rising sea levels, primarily driven by global warming and the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, have numerous and far-reaching consequences for both natural environments and human societies. These consequences are a direct result of the thermal expansion of seawater as it warms and the additional water contributed by melting ice. The impacts of rising sea levels include:

Coastal Erosion:

Rising sea levels can lead to more frequent and severe coastal erosion. Higher water levels exacerbate the erosion of beaches, shorelines, and coastal cliffs, which can threaten property, infrastructure, and habitats.
Inundation of Low-Lying Areas:

Low-lying coastal areas are at risk of permanent inundation. This can result in the loss of land, displacement of communities, and the destruction of infrastructure and ecosystems.
Saltwater Intrusion:

Rising seas can cause saltwater to intrude into freshwater aquifers, contaminating sources of drinking water and agricultural irrigation.
Threat to Ecosystems:

Coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, salt marshes, and coral reefs, are vulnerable to sea-level rise. These ecosystems provide vital habitat for wildlife, protect against storm surges, and offer nurseries for marine life. Their loss can disrupt the balance of local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity.
Impact on Agriculture:

Low-lying coastal agricultural areas are at risk of saltwater intrusion and inundation, leading to soil degradation and reduced crop productivity.
Increased Flooding:

Higher sea levels contribute to more frequent and severe coastal flooding during storms, particularly during high tides. This can result in property damage, economic losses, and threats to public safety.
Displacement of Populations:

Rising sea levels can force the relocation of coastal communities, leading to climate-induced displacement and refugee crises. This has social, economic, and political ramifications.
Loss of Cultural Heritage:

Coastal communities with rich cultural histories may lose valuable heritage sites and cultural landmarks due to inundation and erosion.
Economic Costs:

Sea-level rise can result in significant economic costs, including damage to infrastructure, increased insurance premiums, and reduced property values in vulnerable coastal areas.
Increased Storm Surge Risk:

Rising sea levels amplify the impact of storm surges, making hurricanes and cyclones more destructive and posing greater risks to coastal populations.
Infrastructure Vulnerability:

Infrastructure in coastal regions, including ports, roads, airports, and wastewater treatment facilities, can be more susceptible to damage and disruption due to sea-level rise.
Health Risks:

Coastal flooding can contaminate water supplies and lead to the spread of waterborne diseases, posing health risks to communities affected by rising sea levels.
National Security Implications:

The consequences of rising sea levels can have national security implications, including potential conflicts over land and resources, as well as the displacement of vulnerable populations.
Addressing the impacts of rising sea levels requires a multifaceted approach, including efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the changes that are already occurring, and implement strategies such as coastal protection, managed retreat, and improved land-use planning. International cooperation is essential, as many countries are vulnerable to sea-level rise, and the consequences can have global implications.",0
"Rising sea levels pose a serious threat to coastal life around the world. The consequences include increased intensity of storm surges, flooding, and damage to coastal areas. In many cases, this is where large population centers are located, in addition to fragile wildlife habitats 12. When sea levels rise as rapidly as they have been, even a small increase can have devastating effects on coastal habitats. Farther inland, it can cause destructive erosion, wetland flooding, aquifer and agricultural soil contamination with salt, and lost habitat for fish, birds, and plants 3. The effects of sea level rise are already being felt, and the forecasts are not very hopeful. Water is increasingly invading coastal areas, causing soil erosion and threatening farmland, housing or recreation areas 4.",0

Rising sea levels

Increased flooding: As sea levels rise, more and more land will be flooded, both during high tides and during storms. This will displace people and businesses, damage property, and contaminate groundwater.
Erosion: Rising sea levels will also cause erosion of coastlines, which will further damage property and infrastructure.
Saltwater intrusion: As sea levels rise, saltwater will intrude further inland, contaminating freshwater supplies and making it more difficult to grow crops.
Increased storm surge: Storm surge is the rise in sea level caused by a storm. Rising sea levels will increase the height and intensity of storm surge, making coastal communities more vulnerable to storm damage.
Loss of wetlands: Wetlands are coastal areas that are flooded by saltwater at high tide. Wetlands provide a number of important ecosystem services, such as filtering water, providing habitat for wildlife, and protecting coastlines from erosion. Rising sea levels will cause many wetlands to disappear.

The consequences of rising sea levels are already being felt around the world. For example, in the United States, sea levels have risen by about 8 inches since the late 19th century. This has caused increased flooding in coastal communities, such as Miami and New Orleans. Sea levels are also rising in other parts of the world, such as Asia, Africa, and Europe.

The consequences of rising sea levels are likely to become more severe in the coming years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that sea levels could rise by up to 3.6 feet by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. This would have a devastating impact on coastal communities around the world.

We need to take action now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the consequences of rising sea levels. We can do this by switching to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and reducing deforestation. We also need to help coastal communities adapt to the impacts of rising sea levels, such as by building seawalls and elevating buildings.

By taking action now, we can reduce the risks posed by rising sea levels and protect coastal communities around the world.",0
"A carbon offset is a credit that a person or organization can buy to decrease its carbon footprint. When the number of carbon offset credits obtained is equal to an individual or organization's carbon footprint, that person or organization is carbon-neutral.",0
"The concepts of ""carbon footprint"" and ""carbon offsetting"" are related to the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. They are used to measure and mitigate the environmental impact of human activities and products. Here's an explanation of each concept:

1. Carbon Footprint:

A carbon footprint is a measure of the total greenhouse gas emissions, typically expressed in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), associated with an individual, organization, event, product, or activity. It quantifies the impact of human actions on the environment in terms of their contribution to global warming. A carbon footprint can be broken down into two main categories:

Direct Emissions: These are emissions from sources directly owned or controlled by an individual or organization. For example, the burning of fossil fuels for transportation, heating, or electricity in a household or the emissions from an organization's vehicles and facilities.

Indirect Emissions: These are emissions associated with activities or products that are not directly controlled but are part of the supply chain or consumption patterns. Indirect emissions can include the emissions from manufacturing a product, transporting goods, or even the emissions associated with the food and goods you consume.

Calculating a carbon footprint involves estimating emissions from various sources, including energy use, transportation, consumption, and more. Once the carbon footprint is determined, individuals and organizations can take steps to reduce their emissions, such as using energy-efficient appliances, adopting renewable energy sources, and reducing waste.

2. Carbon Offsetting:

Carbon offsetting is a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of activities or products by investing in projects that reduce or capture an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. These projects, often called carbon offset projects, can include activities like:

Reforestation and Afforestation: Planting trees or restoring forests, which absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Renewable Energy Projects: Supporting wind, solar, hydroelectric, or other renewable energy projects that generate clean energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Energy Efficiency Programs: Investing in projects that increase energy efficiency, reducing emissions from energy use.

Methane Capture: Capturing and using methane emissions from landfills and agricultural operations, preventing them from entering the atmosphere.

Clean Cookstove Initiatives: Providing cleaner and more efficient cookstoves to households in developing countries, reducing the emissions from traditional cooking methods.

Waste Reduction and Recycling: Supporting programs that reduce waste and promote recycling, preventing emissions from waste decomposition.

Carbon offset projects are typically verified and certified by reputable organizations to ensure that they result in real emissions reductions. When individuals or organizations purchase carbon offsets, they are essentially compensating for their own emissions by investing in projects that remove or prevent an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from being released into the atmosphere.

Carbon offsetting is often used as a way to take immediate action to combat climate change while efforts are made to reduce one's carbon footprint through emission reduction strategies. However, it is important to prioritize emission reduction over offsetting, as reducing emissions at the source is the most effective way to address climate change. Carbon offsetting should be viewed as a supplementary approach in the broader effort to combat global warming.",0
"Carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities, such as driving a car, using electricity, or eating meat 1. Carbon footprint is measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) 1.

Carbon offsetting is a way to balance out the carbon emissions that an individual or organization produces by investing in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere 1. For example, a company might invest in a project that plants trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or it might invest in a wind farm to generate clean energy and reduce the need for fossil fuels 1. By investing in these projects, the company can offset its carbon emissions and become carbon neutral 1.

Carbon offsetting is not a perfect solution to climate change, but it can be an effective way for individuals and organizations to take responsibility for their carbon emissions and support projects that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 1.",0

By taking these steps, we can all make a difference in protecting our planet for future generations.

Here are some specific examples of how individuals and communities have contributed to environmental sustainability:

Individuals have started community gardens to grow their own food and to provide fresh, healthy food for their neighbors.
Communities have come together to develop and implement renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms.
Individuals and businesses have worked together to reduce waste and recycle more materials.
Communities have advocated for and passed policies that protect the environment, such as bans on single-use plastics and regulations on carbon emissions.
These are just a few examples of how individuals and communities can contribute to environmental sustainability. By working together, we can make a big difference in protecting our planet.",0
"The benefits of conserving biodiversity
Preserving genetic diversity ensures the continuing existence of a wide-range of crops that may be able to withstand disease, and potentially useful biochemicals such as those used in healthcare. It also means availability of species for pollination and pest control.",0
"Biodiversity conservation is of paramount importance for a variety of reasons, as it contributes to the well-being of ecosystems, human societies, and the planet as a whole. Here are some of the key reasons why biodiversity conservation is crucial:

Ecosystem Stability: Biodiversity plays a fundamental role in maintaining the stability and resilience of ecosystems. Diverse ecosystems are better able to adapt to environmental changes and disturbances, such as climate fluctuations, diseases, and invasive species. Biodiversity acts as a form of natural insurance, reducing the risk of ecosystem collapse.

Ecosystem Services: Biodiversity provides a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential for human survival and well-being. These services include clean air and water, pollination of crops, regulation of climate, decomposition of organic matter, nutrient cycling, and the provision of food, medicine, and materials.

Genetic Diversity: Biodiversity is a source of genetic diversity, which is critical for breeding programs in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. Genetic diversity ensures that species can adapt to changing conditions and resist diseases.

Food Security: Biodiversity is vital for global food security. Diverse ecosystems provide a variety of plant and animal species that can be used for food, helping to reduce the reliance on a limited number of crops and livestock.

Medicine and Pharmaceuticals: Many medicines and pharmaceuticals are derived from plants and animals. Biodiversity provides a vast genetic library of potentially life-saving compounds.

Economic Benefits: Biodiversity contributes to local and national economies through tourism, recreation, and the sustainable use of natural resources, such as timber, fish, and non-timber forest products.

Aesthetic and Cultural Value: Biodiversity has intrinsic value as part of the natural world and has aesthetic and cultural significance. Many people find solace, inspiration, and recreation in natural environments, and numerous cultures have spiritual and cultural connections to particular species or ecosystems.

Climate Change Mitigation: Forests and other ecosystems with high biodiversity contribute to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. They play a vital role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in vegetation and soils.

Pollination: Biodiversity, especially the diversity of pollinators such as bees and butterflies, is essential for the pollination of plants. This process is crucial for the reproduction of many food crops and wild plants.

Protection Against Pests and Diseases: Biodiversity can help control pests and diseases by maintaining a balance among species. Predators and parasites of pests help keep their populations in check.

Water Purification: Wetlands and other ecosystems rich in biodiversity act as natural filters, helping to purify water by removing pollutants and impurities.

Resilience to Natural Disasters: Biodiverse coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and coral reefs, can act as natural buffers against storm surges and tsunamis, protecting communities from natural disasters.

Scientific and Educational Value: Biodiversity provides a rich source of knowledge and inspiration for scientific research and education. Understanding biodiversity is essential for addressing ecological and environmental challenges.

Ethical and Moral Reasons: Many people believe in the intrinsic value of all living beings and ecosystems and consider it an ethical and moral duty to protect and preserve biodiversity.

Interconnectedness of Life: Biodiversity reminds us of the intricate web of life and the interdependence of species. The loss of one species can have cascading effects throughout an ecosystem and beyond.

The rapid loss of biodiversity, driven by factors like habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and overexploitation, poses significant threats to the environment and human societies. Conservation efforts are essential to mitigate these threats and to ensure that ecosystems continue to provide the services and benefits necessary for a sustainable and healthy planet.

"Biodiversity conservation is essential for the processes that support all life on Earth, including humans. Without a wide range of animals, plants, and microorganisms, we cannot have healthy ecosystems. Biodiversity is important to most aspects of our lives. We value biodiversity for many reasons, some utilitarian, some intrinsic. This means we value biodiversity both for what it provides to humans and for the value it has in its own right 1.

Biodiversity maximizes the future potential to unlock benefits to human health. Pollinators such as birds, bees, and other insects are estimated to be responsible for a third of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crop production. Without pollinators, we would not have apples, cherries, blueberries, almonds, and many other foods we eat. Agriculture is also reliant upon invertebrates Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they help to maintain the health of the soil crops grow in. Soil is teeming with microbes that are vital for liberating nutrients that plants need to grow, which are then also passed to us when we eat them. Life from the oceans provides the main source of animal protein for many people. Trees and other plants clean the air we breathe and help us tackle the global challenge of climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide 1.

Biodiversity conservation involves promoting a balance between the environment, society, and development in line with the sustainable development goals. The loss of biodiversity can be prevented through conservation efforts that seek to protect lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s variety at all levels of biological organization 2.",0

Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, including all plants, animals, fungi, and microorganisms. It is essential for the health of our planet and for our own well-being.

Biodiversity provides us with many essential services, including:

Food: A wide variety of plants and animals are used to produce the food that we eat.
Medicine: Many of the medicines that we use are derived from plants and animals.
Clean air and water: Plants and animals help to clean the air and water that we rely on.
Climate regulation: Plants and animals help to regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Recreation and enjoyment: We enjoy spending time in nature and observing the many different plants and animals that live there.
Biodiversity is also important for the resilience of our ecosystems. Ecosystems with a high biodiversity are better able to withstand disturbances, such as droughts, floods, and fires.

When biodiversity is lost, it can have a cascading effect on ecosystems and on the people who rely on them. For example, the loss of pollinators can lead to a decline in crop yields. The loss of predators can lead to an increase in pests. And the loss of trees can lead to soil erosion and flooding.

We need to protect biodiversity for the sake of our planet and for our own well-being. There are a number of things that we can do to help conserve biodiversity, including:

Protecting habitats: We need to protect the places where plants and animals live. This includes protecting forests, grasslands, wetlands, and other natural areas.
Reducing pollution: Pollution can harm plants and animals and disrupt ecosystems. We need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and other sources of pollution.
Managing resources sustainably: We need to manage our resources, such as water, fish, and timber, in a sustainable way. This means using resources in a way that does not harm the environment or future generations.
Supporting sustainable agriculture and forestry: We can support sustainable agriculture and forestry practices that protect biodiversity and the environment.
Educating others about the importance of biodiversity: We can educate others about the importance of biodiversity and the things that they can do to help conserve it.
By taking these steps, we can all help to protect biodiversity for future generations.",0
"The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics about a fictional scenario in which an onlooker has the choice to save 5 people in danger of being hit by a trolley, by diverting the trolley to kill just 1 person.",0
"The trolley problem is a well-known ethical thought experiment in the field of moral philosophy, particularly in the area of ethics known as normative ethics. It poses a moral dilemma that forces individuals to consider complex moral and ethical choices.

The classic trolley problem scenario goes like this:

Imagine there is a runaway trolley (or tram) on a track heading toward five people who are tied up and unable to move. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto another track. However, on the other track, there is one person tied up. You have to decide whether to pull the lever to redirect the trolley, potentially saving the five people but causing the death of the one person on the other track.

The trolley problem presents a moral conundrum because it forces individuals to grapple with the ethical principles of utilitarianism (maximizing overall happiness or minimizing overall harm) versus deontological ethics (duty-based ethics, where actions are evaluated based on principles and rules, regardless of consequences). In this case, the dilemma is often framed as a conflict between saving more lives (utilitarian perspective) and not intentionally causing harm to an innocent person (deontological perspective).

There are various versions and variations of the trolley problem that explore different ethical dilemmas, including scenarios where the individual has to directly act to harm someone to save others or where the harm is a result of inaction. The trolley problem has been a subject of extensive philosophical discussion and debate, with scholars exploring different moral theories and perspectives to address the ethical choices it presents.

The trolley problem serves as a thought experiment to stimulate ethical thinking, analyze moral intuitions, and explore the limitations and challenges of ethical theories. It has real-world relevance in fields such as ethics, law, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles, where decisions regarding human lives and moral choices need to be programmed or addressed.

"The trolley problem is a thought experiment in moral philosophy that poses a dilemma of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number 1. It was first introduced by Philippa Foot as a way of exploring the doctrine of double effect and the difference between negative and positive duties. The trolley problem also illustrates the contrast between consequentialist and deontological approaches to morality, as well as the psychological factors that influence moral judgments 1.

The basic scenario involves a runaway trolley that is heading towards five people who are tied up on the tracks. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto another track, where only one person is tied up. The dilemma is whether to pull the lever and sacrifice one person to save five people 1.

The trolley problem has been used to explore a wide range of ethical issues, including the nature of moral reasoning, the role of intention in moral decision-making, and the relationship between ethics and psychology 1.",0

The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.) are presented, with the goal of exploring the ethics of sacrificing one to save many.

The trolley problem is used to explore a number of ethical issues, including:

The trolley problem highlights the difference between deontological and consequentialist ethical systems. Deontological ethics are based on the idea that certain actions are right or wrong regardless of the consequences. Consequentialist ethics, on the other hand, are based on the idea that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by its consequences.
The trolley problem also raises the question of whether or not it is right to actively inhibit the utility of an individual if doing so produces a greater utility for other individuals. In the classic trolley problem scenario, for example, one person could be killed to save five others. This raises the question of whether or not it is right to sacrifice one person for the greater good.
There is no easy answer to the trolley problem. It is a complex ethical dilemma that has been debated by philosophers and psychologists for many years. There are strong arguments to be made on both sides of the issue.

Ultimately, each individual must decide for themselves what they believe is the right thing to do in a trolley problem scenario. There is no right or wrong answer, and each individual's decision will be based on their own personal values and beliefs.

It is important to note that the trolley problem is a thought experiment. It is unlikely that anyone will ever face a real-life situation that is exactly like the trolley problem scenario. However, the trolley problem is a useful tool for thinking about ethical issues and for making decisions in difficult situations.",0
"All of the ethical principles benefit patients by guaranteeing respect for their autonomy and equitable treatment, and that they will receive the best care available based on their beliefs and decisions. This has the effect of allowing the patient to trust their healthcare practitioner without reservation.",0
"Ethical principles play a central role in guiding medical decision-making, ensuring that healthcare professionals make decisions that prioritize the well-being and rights of patients while adhering to moral and ethical standards. Four fundamental ethical principles that commonly guide medical decision-making are:

Autonomy: Autonomy refers to an individual's right to make decisions about their own medical care and to have those decisions respected by healthcare professionals. In the medical context, this principle emphasizes the importance of informed consent. Patients have the right to be fully informed about their medical condition, treatment options, and potential risks and benefits, allowing them to make decisions that align with their values and preferences. Healthcare professionals should respect and support patients in making autonomous decisions, even if they disagree with those choices, as long as they are made with competence and informed understanding.

Beneficence: The principle of beneficence requires healthcare professionals to act in the best interests of their patients and promote their well-being. This includes providing competent and compassionate care, using the best available evidence, and striving to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients. Beneficence guides healthcare providers to prioritize the welfare of the patient above all else, making every effort to improve the patient's health and relieve suffering.

Nonmaleficence: Nonmaleficence, often stated as ""do no harm,"" is the ethical duty to avoid causing harm to patients. Healthcare professionals should take steps to minimize the potential risks and side effects associated with medical treatments and procedures, and they should carefully consider the balance between potential benefits and harms. When harm is unavoidable, healthcare providers must justify it in light of the overall benefit to the patient.

Justice: The principle of justice emphasizes fairness and equity in the distribution of healthcare resources and the provision of care. Healthcare professionals should ensure that healthcare services are distributed without discrimination, and they should consider the needs of vulnerable and marginalized populations. Justice also applies to resource allocation, particularly in situations where resources are scarce, ensuring that decisions are made impartially and based on ethical and medical criteria, rather than bias or discrimination.

In medical decision-making, these principles often intersect and can sometimes come into conflict. Healthcare professionals must engage in ethical deliberation and apply these principles to make decisions that strike a balance between the potentially competing ethical considerations.

Furthermore, it's essential to note that medical ethics is not limited to these four principles, and there are other important principles, such as veracity (truth-telling), confidentiality, and fidelity (loyalty), that also guide medical practice. Ethical frameworks and guidelines, along with input from patients and their families, often help healthcare professionals navigate complex medical situations and make morally sound decisions.

In addition to these ethical principles, healthcare professionals are guided by legal and regulatory frameworks, codes of ethics, and institutional policies that help ensure the provision of safe and ethical care. Ethical dilemmas can be complex, and in such cases, healthcare professionals may seek guidance from ethics committees or consult with bioethicists to arrive at ethically sound decisions.",0
"Ethical principles play a crucial role in medical decision-making. The four key principles of medical ethics are:

Autonomy: This principle emphasizes the importance of respecting the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right to make their own decisions about their healthcare 1.

Beneficence: This principle requires healthcare providers to act in the best interests of their patients and to do no harm 2.

Non-maleficence: This principle requires healthcare providers to avoid causing harm to their patients 2.

Justice: This principle requires healthcare providers to treat all patients fairly and equitably, regardless of their background or circumstances 1.

These principles provide a framework for ethical decision-making in medicine. They help guide healthcare providers in making decisions that are in the best interests of their patients while respecting their autonomy and dignity 1.

For example, when a patient is unable to make decisions for themselves, healthcare providers must consider the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wishes, values, and beliefs when making decisions on their behalf 1. In addition, healthcare providers must ensure that they are providing care that is appropriate for the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s condition and that they are not causing harm 2.",0
"
Ethical principles apply to medical decision-making in a number of ways. These principles include:

Autonomy: This principle means that patients have the right to make their own decisions about their medical care. This includes the right to choose or refuse treatment.
Beneficence: This principle means that it is important to act in the best interests of the patient. This includes providing the patient with the best possible care and avoiding harm.
Non-maleficence: This principle means that it is important to do no harm to the patient. This includes avoiding unnecessary risks and side effects.
Justice: This principle means that patients should be treated fairly. This includes treating all patients with respect and providing them with access to the care they need.
Ethical principles are applied to medical decision-making through a process called informed consent. Informed consent is a process in which the patient is provided with all of the necessary information about a medical procedure or treatment so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not to proceed.

The patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice are all considered when doctors and healthcare professionals provide informed consent. Doctors and other healthcare professionals should:

Explain the purpose of the procedure or treatment: Doctors should explain the purpose of the procedure or treatment in a way that the patient can understand.
Describe the risks and benefits: Doctors should describe the risks and benefits of the procedure or treatment in a way that the patient can understand.
Answer the patient's questions: Doctors should answer the patient's questions about the procedure or treatment honestly and completely.
Respect the patient's decision: Doctors should respect the patient's decision about whether or not to proceed with the procedure or treatment.
By following the process of informed consent, doctors and healthcare professionals can ensure that they are respecting the patient's autonomy and making medical decisions that are in the patient's best interests.

Here are some examples of how ethical principles are applied to medical decision-making:

A patient with cancer is considering surgery, but they are afraid of the risks. The doctor should explain the risks and benefits of surgery in a way that the patient can understand. The doctor should also answer the patient's questions about surgery and address their concerns.
A patient is refusing to take their medication, even though their doctor has explained the importance of taking it. The doctor should talk to the patient about their concerns and try to understand why they are refusing to take their medication. The doctor should also provide the patient with information about the risks of not taking their medication.
**A doctor is considering enrolling a patient in a clinical trial for a new drug. The doctor should explain the risks and benefits of participating in the clinical trial in a way that the patient can understand. The doctor should also answer the patient's questions about the clinical trial.
By applying ethical principles to medical decision-making, doctors and healthcare professionals can ensure that they are providing the best possible care to their patients.",0
Privacy: Privacy is a critical consideration for ethical AI. This means taking steps to protect user data and ensure that it is not misused or mishandled. Safety: Ensuring the safety of users is another important ethical consideration for AI. This means taking steps to prevent accidents or harm caused by AI systems.,0
"Ethical considerations in artificial intelligence (AI) are of paramount importance due to the growing impact of AI technologies on society, individuals, and various aspects of human life. Ethical concerns in AI encompass a wide range of issues, and addressing them is essential to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and humane manner. Here are some key ethical considerations in AI:

Bias and Fairness:

Ethical concerns arise when AI systems exhibit bias in their decision-making, favoring certain groups over others. This can lead to discrimination, reinforcing existing social inequalities. Ensuring fairness and equity in AI algorithms is a crucial ethical goal.
Transparency and Explainability:

AI systems, particularly deep learning models, can be complex and difficult to understand. Ensuring transparency and explainability in AI is vital to building trust and accountability. Users should have a clear understanding of how AI systems arrive at their decisions.
Privacy and Data Security:

AI often relies on large datasets, and privacy concerns can emerge when personal data is collected and used without informed consent. Ensuring data security, user consent, and compliance with data protection regulations is an ethical imperative.
Accountability and Responsibility:

Determining accountability for AI decisions and actions is challenging but necessary. Ethical questions arise when AI systems make mistakes, and it can be unclear who is responsible. Establishing mechanisms for accountability and assigning responsibility is crucial.
Safety and Risk Mitigation:

AI systems can have real-world consequences, and safety considerations are paramount. Ensuring that AI technologies are rigorously tested and have mechanisms to mitigate risks is an ethical duty.
Human Autonomy and Control:

Ethical concerns revolve around the potential loss of human autonomy and control when AI systems make important decisions. It is essential to maintain human oversight and control in critical domains.
Job Displacement and Employment:

The automation of jobs through AI can lead to job displacement and economic disruptions. Ethical considerations include retraining and reskilling the workforce to adapt to AI-driven changes.
Informed Consent and User Agency:

Users should have informed consent when interacting with AI systems, and they should be able to make decisions about how their data is used. Preserving user agency and consent is an ethical obligation.
Security and Malicious Use:

Ethical concerns emerge when AI technology is used for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks or deepfakes. AI developers and users have a responsibility to enhance security and prevent harm.
Environmental Impact:

The energy consumption of AI systems, particularly large-scale deep learning models, has raised ethical concerns about their environmental impact. Developing more energy-efficient AI is an ethical imperative.
Discrimination and Harms:

AI systems can perpetuate discrimination and cause harm, such as in predictive policing or credit scoring. Identifying and mitigating these harms is an ethical challenge.
International and Global Impact:

Ethical considerations extend to AI's global impact. Ensuring that AI technologies do not exacerbate global inequalities and respecting international norms is important.
Ethical AI Research and Development:

Ethical AI development involves considering the broader societal implications of AI projects, including potential harms and benefits.
Continual Learning and Adaptation:

AI systems that can adapt and learn from their environments pose ethical challenges related to their behavior and decision-making. Ensuring that AI learns ethical behavior is important.
Human-AI Collaboration:

Designing AI systems that facilitate productive and ethical collaboration with humans is essential in various domains, from healthcare to education.
Addressing these ethical considerations requires a multidisciplinary approach involving AI developers, policymakers, ethicists, and the broader public. Ethical guidelines, regulations, and ethical impact assessments are tools used to navigate these challenges and ensure the responsible development and use of AI technologies.

"The ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to address the moral and ethical implications of AI systems. The ethical considerations in AI include transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy, safety, and security 1.

Transparency is important because it allows users to understand how AI systems work and how they make decisions. Fairness is important because it ensures that AI systems do not discriminate against individuals or groups. Accountability is important because it ensures that AI systems are held responsible for their actions. Privacy is important because it ensures that individualsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ personal information is protected. Safety and security are important because they ensure that AI systems do not cause harm to individuals or society 1.

The ethical considerations in AI are complex and multifaceted. They require a careful balance between the benefits of AI and the potential risks and harms associated with its use. As such, it is important to develop ethical frameworks that can guide the development and use of AI systems in a responsible and ethical manner 1.",0
"As AI continues to develop and become more sophisticated, it is imperative that we consider the ethical implications of its development and use. Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of issues, including:

Bias and fairness: AI systems are trained on data that is collected from the real world. This data can reflect the biases that exist in our society, which can lead to AI systems that are biased in their decision-making. For example, an AI system that is used to make decisions about who gets a loan may be biased against certain racial or ethnic groups.
Transparency and accountability: It is important to be able to understand how AI systems work and to hold them accountable for their decisions. This can be difficult, as AI systems are often complex and opaque. For example, it can be difficult to understand how an AI system that is used to make decisions about who gets a job makes its decisions.
Privacy and security: AI systems collect and store large amounts of data. This data can be used to track people's movements, monitor their communications, and predict their behavior. It is important to protect this data from unauthorized access and to ensure that it is used in a responsible manner. For example, an AI system that is used to track people's movements could be used to track people's political activities or their religious beliefs.
Autonomy and control: As AI systems become more sophisticated, it is important to consider the question of who should be in control of these systems. Should AI systems be allowed to make their own decisions, or should they be controlled by humans? For example, an AI system that is used to control a self-driving car could make the decision to swerve into a wall to avoid hitting a pedestrian.
Safety and security: AI systems are increasingly being used in safety-critical applications, such as in self-driving cars and medical devices. It is important to ensure that these systems are safe and that they can be trusted to make the right decisions. For example, an AI system that is used to control a self-driving car should be able to safely navigate all types of road conditions.
These are just a few of the ethical considerations that we need to address as we continue to develop and use AI. It is important to have a public conversation about these issues and to develop guidelines for the responsible development and use of AI.

Here are some things that we can do to address the ethical considerations of AI:

Increase diversity and inclusion in the development of AI systems. This will help to reduce bias in AI systems.
Make AI systems more transparent and accountable. This can be done by developing methods for explaining how AI systems work and by holding AI systems accountable for their decisions.
Develop strong privacy and security measures for AI systems. This will help to protect people's data and to prevent AI systems from being misused.
Establish clear guidelines for the development and use of AI systems. These guidelines should be developed by a diverse group of stakeholders, including ethicists, technologists, and policymakers.
Educate the public about AI. This will help people to understand the potential benefits and risks of AI and to make informed decisions about its use.
By taking these steps, we can help to ensure that AI is developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner.

"Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism because it rests on the idea that it is the consequences or results of actions, laws, policies, etc. that determine whether they are good or bad, right or wrong. In general, whatever is being evaluated, we ought to choose the one that will produce the best overall results.
",0
"Utilitarianism is a moral and ethical theory that was developed in the 18th and 19th centuries by philosophers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. It is a consequentialist theory, meaning that it judges the morality of an action based on the consequences it produces. The fundamental principle of utilitarianism is often stated as ""the greatest happiness for the greatest number."" In other words, an action is considered morally right if it produces the greatest overall happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people.

Key aspects of utilitarianism include:

Hedonism: Utilitarianism is often associated with hedonism, the idea that pleasure is the highest good and pain is the greatest evil. Utilitarians seek to maximize overall pleasure and minimize overall pain.

Utility: Utility, in utilitarian terms, refers to the measure of happiness or pleasure. Actions that increase overall utility are considered morally right, while those that decrease it are morally wrong.

Consequentialism: Utilitarians focus on the consequences of actions, rather than the inherent nature of the actions themselves. This means that the morality of an action can change depending on the specific circumstances.

Criticisms of Utilitarianism:

Lack of Rights and Justice: One common criticism of utilitarianism is that it can lead to the violation of individual rights and justice. In the pursuit of the greatest overall happiness, utilitarianism may justify sacrificing the rights and interests of a minority for the benefit of the majority.

Calculating Utility: Measuring and comparing the utility of different actions and their consequences can be complex and subjective. It's often difficult to quantify and compare pleasures and pains in a precise and objective manner.

The Problem of Injustice: Critics argue that utilitarianism can lead to morally questionable outcomes, such as justifying the oppression or suffering of a minority group if it results in a net gain of happiness for the majority.

Difficulty in Predicting Consequences: It can be challenging to predict all the consequences of an action, and some may only become apparent in the long term. This uncertainty can make it difficult to apply utilitarian principles in practice.

Preference Satisfaction: Some modern forms of utilitarianism shift the focus from mere pleasure and pain to the satisfaction of preferences. Critics argue that this version still faces challenges in defining and comparing preferences.

Supererogatory Acts: Utilitarianism tends to focus on what is morally required (acts that maximize utility). Critics argue that it may not adequately account for morally supererogatory actsÃ¢â‚¬â€acts that go beyond what is required but are morally praiseworthy.

The ""Tyranny of the Majority"": Utilitarianism may lead to situations where the majority imposes their preferences and values on the minority, potentially resulting in unfair outcomes.

Despite these criticisms, utilitarianism remains influential in ethics and has evolved into various forms, including rule utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism, which attempt to address some of these concerns while retaining the core idea of maximizing overall well-being. It continues to be a subject of debate and discussion among ethicists and philosophers.

"Utilitarianism is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people. According to this theory, an action is right if it promotes happiness and wrong if it produces the reverse of happiness 1.

The philosophy of utilitarianism is based on the idea that the moral worth of an action is determined solely by its contribution to overall utility, which is defined as the sum of all pleasure and pain that results from that action 2.

However, utilitarianism faces several criticisms, such as:

Difficulty in quantifying and comparing human happiness: It is difficult or impossible to quantify and compare human happiness 1.
Ignoring the distribution and justice of happiness among individuals and groups: Utilitarianism ignores the distribution and justice of happiness among individuals and groups 1.
Not considering the motives, intentions, and character of the moral agents: Utilitarianism does not consider the motives, intentions, and character of the moral agents 1.
Justifying bad actions or violating human rights if they produce more happiness: Utilitarianism may justify bad actions or violate human rights if they produce more happiness 1.
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to note that these criticisms do not necessarily invalidate utilitarianism as a moral theory. Rather, they highlight some of its limitations and encourage further discussion on how to improve it.",0
"
Utilitarianism is a normative ethical theory that holds that the right action is the one that maximizes utility, which is typically defined as happiness, well-being, or pleasure. Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, which means that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences.

Utilitarianism has been one of the most influential ethical theories in the Western world since the 18th century. It has been used to justify a wide range of social and political reforms, including the abolition of slavery, the expansion of voting rights, and the creation of social welfare programs.

However, utilitarianism has also been criticized on a number of grounds. One common criticism is that it is too simplistic. Utilitarianism reduces all moral decisions to a single question: ""What action will produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people?"" This can lead to difficult and controversial conclusions, such as the idea that it is sometimes morally permissible to sacrifice the happiness of a few individuals for the greater good of the majority.

Another common criticism of utilitarianism is that it is too demanding. Utilitarianism requires us to always act in the way that will produce the greatest overall happiness, even if this means sacrificing our own happiness or the happiness of people close to us. This can be a very difficult standard to live up to, and it is not clear that it is always possible to know what action will actually produce the greatest overall happiness.

Despite its critics, utilitarianism remains an influential ethical theory. It continues to be used by philosophers, economists, and policymakers to make decisions about a wide range of social and political issues.

Here are some specific criticisms of utilitarianism:

Utilitarianism can lead to unjust outcomes. For example, if a society believes that it is morally permissible to sacrifice the happiness of a few individuals for the greater good of the majority, this could lead to the oppression of minority groups.
Utilitarianism can be difficult to apply in practice. It is often difficult to predict the consequences of our actions, and it can be even more difficult to compare the happiness of different individuals.
Utilitarianism can ignore other important moral considerations, such as justice, rights, and duties. For example, a utilitarian might argue that it is morally permissible to lie or steal if doing so would produce the greatest overall happiness. However, many people would disagree with this conclusion, even if they agree with the general principle of utilitarianism.
Overall, utilitarianism is a complex and controversial ethical theory. It has both strengths and weaknesses, and it is important to be aware of its limitations before applying it to real-world decisions.

Virtue ethics is a broad term for theories that emphasize the role of character and virtue in moral philosophy rather than either doing one's duty or acting in order to bring about good consequences.,0
"Virtue ethics is a moral and ethical theory that focuses on the development of good character traits and moral virtues as the foundation of ethical decision-making. Unlike consequentialist theories (e.g., utilitarianism) that emphasize the consequences of actions, or deontological theories (e.g., Kantian ethics) that stress adherence to moral rules or duties, virtue ethics places the emphasis on the moral character of the individual.

Key concepts of virtue ethics include:

Virtues: Virtue ethics identifies specific character traits or virtues that are considered morally good and valuable, such as honesty, courage, compassion, integrity, humility, and wisdom. These virtues are seen as fundamental to living a morally good life.

Moral Exemplars: Virtue ethics often looks to moral exemplars, individuals who embody virtuous qualities and serve as role models for others. These exemplars demonstrate how to lead a morally virtuous life through their actions and character.

Eudaimonia: A central concept in virtue ethics is eudaimonia, which is often translated as ""flourishing"" or ""living a fulfilled life."" Virtue ethicists argue that the path to eudaimonia is through the development and practice of virtuous character traits.

Phronesis: Phronesis, or practical wisdom, is the ability to make morally sound decisions by considering the specific context and circumstances. Virtue ethics places great importance on the practical judgment and discernment of individuals in determining the right course of action.

Moral Education: Virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of moral education and personal development. It suggests that individuals should cultivate virtuous qualities over time and learn from their experiences and interactions with others.

Criticisms and Debates:

Cultural Relativism: Critics argue that virtue ethics can be culturally relative, as what is considered virtuous may vary across different cultures and historical periods. This raises questions about the universality of ethical principles.

Lack of Clear Guidance: Some critics contend that virtue ethics does not provide clear guidelines for action in the way that deontological and consequentialist theories do. It may not offer specific answers to moral dilemmas.

Vagueness: Virtue ethics can be criticized for being vague in defining virtues and determining which virtues are the most important. This can lead to subjectivity and disputes about which character traits are genuinely virtuous.

Role of Rules: Virtue ethics does not reject moral rules entirely, but it places less emphasis on them than deontological ethics. Critics argue that some situations may require a more rule-based approach.

Moral Luck: Virtue ethics can be challenged by the notion of moral luck, where the moral character of an individual may not lead to virtuous outcomes due to external factors beyond their control.

Despite these criticisms, virtue ethics has had a significant impact on moral philosophy and has been developed and refined by philosophers like Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and contemporary thinkers such as Alasdair MacIntyre and Rosalind Hursthouse. It offers a different perspective on ethics by focusing on the development of moral character and the importance of living a virtuous life.",0
"Virtue ethics is an approach to ethics that emphasizes the importance of developing good character traits, or virtues, in order to lead a moral life 1. According to this theory, an action is right if it is what a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances 2.

Virtue ethics is different from other ethical theories, such as consequentialism and deontology, which focus on the consequences of actions or adherence to rules, respectively 1. Instead, virtue ethics emphasizes the importance of cultivating virtues such as honesty, courage, compassion, and fairness 1.

The concept of virtue ethics can be traced back to ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato 1. Aristotle believed that virtues are habits that we develop over time through practice and repetition 3. He identified several virtues that he believed were essential for leading a good life, including courage, justice, wisdom, and temperance 3.

One of the strengths of virtue ethics is that it provides a framework for making moral decisions that is flexible and adaptable to different situations 2. However, one criticism of virtue ethics is that it can be difficult to determine which virtues are most important in any given situation 2.",0
"Virtue ethics is a normative ethical theory that focuses on the character of the individual as the basis for morality. Virtue ethicists believe that good people are those who possess and exercise good character traits, or virtues. Virtues are typically understood to be character traits that are conducive to human flourishing, such as courage, honesty, justice, and compassion.

Virtue ethics contrasts with other major ethical theories, such as utilitarianism and deontology, which focus on the consequences of actions or on moral duties, respectively. Virtue ethicists argue that these other theories are too narrow in their focus, and that they fail to account for the importance of character in moral decision-making.

Virtue ethics has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy, particularly in the work of Aristotle. Aristotle believed that the goal of human life is to achieve eudaimonia, which is often translated as ""flourishing"" or ""well-being."" Aristotle argued that eudaimonia is achieved by exercising the virtues, and that the virtues are developed through practice.

In recent years, virtue ethics has experienced a revival in interest among philosophers and ethicists. This is due in part to the perceived shortcomings of other ethical theories, such as utilitarianism and deontology. Virtue ethics is also seen as a more holistic approach to ethics, as it takes into account the whole person, not just their actions or their duties.

Here are some of the key concepts of virtue ethics:

Virtues are character traits that are conducive to human flourishing. Some examples of virtues include courage, honesty, justice, and compassion.
Virtues are developed through practice. We become courageous by acting courageously, honest by acting honestly, and so on.
Virtue is the basis of morality. Good people are those who possess and exercise good character traits.
We should strive to be virtuous people. This means developing and exercising the virtues in our lives.
Virtue ethics is a complex and sophisticated ethical theory. It offers a valuable framework for thinking about the good life and how to live it.

Here are some examples of how virtue ethics can be applied to real-world situations:

A doctor who is honest and compassionate is more likely to provide good care to their patients.
A lawyer who is just and fair is more likely to represent their clients effectively.
A politician who is courageous and principled is more likely to make good decisions for their constituents.
A teacher who is patient and understanding is more likely to help their students learn and grow.
Overall, virtue ethics is a valuable ethical theory that can help us to live good and moral lives.",0
"For instance, there is a chance that genetic alterations could have unintended consequences or that parents may not be able to control which traits their child inherits. Some people believe that designer babies are morally wrong because they involve manipulating the genes of a human embryo.",0
"Genetic engineering has raised a wide range of moral and ethical questions that are subject to ongoing debate. Some of the key moral implications of genetic engineering include:

Autonomy and Consent: Genetic engineering often involves making choices about an individual's genetic makeup before they are born. This raises questions about the autonomy and consent of the person whose genes are being modified, especially in the case of germline editing (modifying genes that can be passed on to future generations). Can an individual truly consent to genetic changes that will affect their entire life?

Equality and Justice: Genetic engineering has the potential to exacerbate existing social inequalities. If access to genetic enhancements or corrections is limited to certain groups or classes, it could lead to disparities in health, intelligence, or physical abilities, further dividing society along genetic lines.

Unintended Consequences: Genetic engineering can have unintended consequences, such as off-target gene editing or unforeseen health risks. The moral dilemma lies in the responsibility for these consequences and how to mitigate them.

Human Dignity: Some argue that manipulating the genetic makeup of individuals may undermine the intrinsic value and dignity of each person by turning them into commodities or projects for enhancement. This can be seen as devaluing the uniqueness and individuality of each human being.

Environmental Impact: Genetic engineering of plants and animals can have ecological and environmental consequences. For example, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can potentially disrupt ecosystems or harm non-target species. Ethical concerns include the responsibility for ecological damage and the potential impacts on future generations.

Safety and Risks: Genetic engineering carries risks, and the question of whether these risks are ethically justifiable depends on the potential benefits and the level of risk involved. Deciding what level of risk is acceptable and who bears the consequences of any failures is a complex ethical issue.

Slippery Slope: Critics of genetic engineering often invoke the ""slippery slope"" argument, suggesting that once we start modifying genes, it may lead to more extreme and ethically problematic applications, such as designer babies with custom-selected traits.

Cultural and Religious Beliefs: Different cultures and religions have varying beliefs about the sanctity of human life, the role of nature, and the morality of genetic manipulation. These belief systems can influence the ethical perspectives on genetic engineering.

Long-term Effects: Genetic modifications can have consequences that extend for generations, raising questions about our responsibility to future generations and the long-term impact of our actions.

Global Governance: Genetic engineering is not limited by national borders, and there is a need for international cooperation and governance to establish ethical guidelines and regulations that ensure responsible use of genetic technologies.

It's important to note that opinions on these moral implications vary widely. Some people see genetic engineering as a way to address medical conditions, increase food production, and enhance human potential, while others view it as a threat to fundamental ethical principles. Ethical debates and discussions are ongoing as the field of genetic engineering continues to advance, and they often involve considerations of principles such as autonomy, justice, beneficence, non-maleficence, and respect for persons.",0
"Genetic engineering is a field that has raised many ethical and moral concerns. One of the most significant issues is the potential misuse of human fetuses for creating and testing genetic modifications, which raises ethical and religious concerns about the sanctity of human life and the dignity of human beings1. Another moral issue is the possibility of human genetic cloning and engineering, which may have unpredictable and harmful consequences. This also challenges the moral values and beliefs of many people who oppose altering the natural order of creation1.

In addition, there are concerns about the potential for genetic engineering to be used to create Ã¢â‚¬Å“designer babiesÃ¢â‚¬Â with specific traits, such as intelligence or physical appearance. This could lead to a society where people are judged based on their genetic makeup, rather than their individual qualities1.

Furthermore, there are concerns about the impact of genetic engineering on the environment. The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in crop and meat production has raised questions about the safety of these products for human consumption1.

In conclusion, while genetic engineering has the potential to bring many benefits to society, it is important to consider the ethical and moral implications of this technology. It is essential to ensure that genetic engineering is used in a responsible manner that respects human dignity, individual rights, and environmental safety.",0
"The moral implications of genetic engineering are vast and complex, as they encompass ethical, religious, philosophical, and social dimensions. Here's an exploration of some key points to consider:

Potential Benefits

Curing diseases: Genetic engineering offers the potential to cure genetic diseases and improve human health significantly. Gene therapy, for example, allows for the correction of defective genes, paving the way for treating currently incurable conditions like cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia.
Enhancing agricultural production: Genetically engineered crops can be designed to be resistant to pests and diseases, improve yields, and require less water and fertilizer. This translates to increased food security and efficient resource utilization.
Developing sustainable solutions: Genetic engineering can contribute to the development of sustainable solutions in various fields. For instance, microbes can be engineered to produce biofuels, reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
Potential Risks and Concerns

Unforeseen consequences: Modifying genes can have unintended and potentially harmful consequences. For example, altering one gene might have unforeseen effects on other genes or the organism's overall health.
Social inequalities: Access to genetic engineering technologies could exacerbate existing social inequalities. Wealthier individuals and nations may have greater access to these technologies, widening the gap between rich and poor.
Loss of biodiversity: The widespread use of genetically engineered organisms could lead to the loss of biodiversity and disrupt natural ecosystems.
""Playing God"": Some argue that genetic engineering goes against the natural order and is akin to ""playing God."" They believe humans should not intervene in the natural processes of evolution and genetic inheritance.
Specific Ethical Issues

Human germline editing: Altering genes in human embryos that will be passed on to future generations raises significant ethical concerns. This could lead to the creation of ""designer babies"" with predetermined traits, potentially leading to discrimination and eugenics.
Animal welfare: Concerns about animal welfare arise with the use of genetically engineered animals in research and agriculture. Ensuring their well-being and minimizing any suffering is crucial.
Environmental impact: The release of genetically modified organisms into the environment requires careful consideration and risk assessment to prevent unintended ecological consequences.
Navigating the Ethical Landscape

Open dialogue and transparency: Public discourse and engagement are crucial for navigating the ethical implications of genetic engineering. Open communication about the benefits, risks, and uncertainties is vital for building trust and making informed decisions.
Regulatory frameworks: Robust regulatory frameworks are necessary to ensure the safe and ethical development and application of genetic engineering technologies. These frameworks should be based on transparent scientific evidence and public input.
International cooperation: Global collaboration is critical for addressing the ethical and regulatory challenges associated with genetic engineering. Sharing knowledge, expertise, and best practices can ensure the responsible and equitable use of this powerful technology.
Conclusion

Genetic engineering presents both immense potential and significant ethical challenges. By carefully considering the potential benefits and risks, fostering open dialogue, and establishing robust regulatory frameworks, we can leverage this powerful technology for the betterment of humanity and the planet. The ethical considerations are complex and evolving, requiring ongoing dialogue and reflection to ensure responsible and equitable use of this technology for the benefit of all.",0
"This essay will explain if drivers should or should not be able to use electronic devices while operating a vehicle. Using a phone while driving can cause very bad wrecks, because they are putting themselves and other people at risk. People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because bad wrecks, putting others' lives in danger, and may cause death.

First of all, wrecks can be caused by looking down at your phone while driving. Most importantly, you should always keep your eyes directly on the road when behind the wheel of a car. On that note, you will have an outrageously car payment just because you were looking down at your phone. Moreover, if you the reason the accident happened the person that was operating the other car can sue you for lots of money, and you will have to pay it. Therefore, if you don't pay whatever the person charges you consequences will be served and that's behind bars.

Another reason why we should not be able to use cell phones while operating an automobile is that you are putting other people's lives in danger. Thus, looking down at your cell phone you can get someone else hurt for the uncommunicative act you committed. As well as unconsciousness, injuries, or being in a hospital.

The main key to not texting and driving while behind the wheel of a car. Mainly, it can cause tragic, terrifying, and horrific things to you and to others and that's death. That's the most important thing to not using electronic devices while operating a vehicle. With the intension, of you not keeping your eyes and staying focus on the road you can easily turn off the road or hit another victim. Possibly another humankind could go away of all flesh because of your stupidity.

Must be remembered, always stay focus on the road so you can get to your destination safely. So, you can't cause accidents, put other people lives in danger, and possibly death. Important to realize, do not use your phone while operating a vehicle. At least, wait till you make a safe stop or until you arrive at your destination.",1
"Driving while the use of cellular devices

Today, most of the society is thoughtless. Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.

The automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.",1
"Phones & Driving

Drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal.

According to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.

According to another article, ""Distracted Driving"" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all while driving.

In conclusion, drivers should not able to work a vehicle while using their cell phone. Drivers who uses their phones while operating a vehicle and are likely to have an accident then those who don't.",1
"Cell Phone Operation While Driving

The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.

Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.

Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.

The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.",1
"Cell phone use should not be legal while driving, it causes many accidents even fatalities. Drivers become careless while driving when using cell phones. Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. The most prevalent distractions are texting and talking on a cell phone while driving. Cell Phone use should not be legal while driving because it will help prevent more accidents and also prevent more deaths. People become distracted while driving when they use cell phones and bring danger into life, the government should regulate stricter laws to citizens about cell phone use on the road.

Drivers are too busy talking on cell phones and not paying attention to the road. Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. Maybe the driver gets a call, gets into an argument, or they are driving too slow. Also another reason is calling while driving can also block out hearing cause the driver is too focused on who is talking, also the driver is less aware of cars around.

This has a big impact on the economy and death rates in the world.

The next reason cell phone use should be illegal while driving is due to texting. This causes the same risks but at a higher rate because you are constantly looking at your phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the driver has no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities.

This is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. Drivers however, underestimate their risks of getting into an accident while using their cell phone on the road. Companies also have this break with reality. They promote things like hand free devices, even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. ""Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.

Overall, they acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk.

State governments should set stricter rules about cell phone use while driving. Death rates are going up rapidly everyday. More and more people are passing away from others not paying attention to their pathway. People are being less cautious and lose focus while being on the road. People should care about their lives and others around them more and should put their phones down until reaching the destination.",1
"Phones and Driving

Driving is a good way to get whatever you need to go in a shorter period of time than on foot. Americans like driving from places such as fast food restaurants to appointments or work. As technology advances and people like to accommodate themselves with technology, we also want this same technology with us even in our vehicles. However if someone is driving with a device I think it is dangerous and can cause serious injuries. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it can be a distraction to not only you but others, can cause a car accident, and it can be illegal . If you are not convinced then I'll explain why driving while on your phone is dangerous.

While driving anywhere you need to always focus on who and what is in your nearby surroundings. In fact, according to driving test.org, ¨ texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving under the influence of alcohol¨ . Since the light refracted off the phone is what you are focused on, vehicles or objects approaching would not get your attention. This is especially true when the phone emits a light with a brighter color or image.

Also best case scenario if you do not cause an accident you may even miss your turn or exit all because you were distracted. Worst case scenario you may cause an accident which I will explain next.

Driving while you are on your phone is not only dangerous because it can be distracting but what happens can lead to a car accident. If you do not take the time to focus on the road, your carelessness may harm pedestrians or other drivers. DrivingTest.org says twenty Texting and Driving makes you 23% more likely to be involved in an accident¨ . It then goes on to say that in 2011, 1.3 million automobiles accidents were caused by this and one can only assume that the numbers have gotten higher with technology advancing. A later text mentions that in 2015

¨3,477 people were killed and 391,000 injured¨ in crashes relating to texting while driving. This can even be illegal are result in murder.

Driving while on your phone can be illegal .If my other two arguments have not you proven that on the phone while driving then hopefully this argument will. Driving while holding your phone is illegal in my state of residence of Georgia. It is illegal under ¨the part of a sweeping hands-free law¨ according to www.usatoday.com `Even though driving with your phone may not be illgeal in your state as stated above it can possibly result in murder. ¨Texting while driving can lead to a homicide charge ¨says pittsburgcriminalattorney.com. The site says you get charged with this if you happen to cause the death of a person due to ¨recklessness¨ or ¨gross negligence¨.

Therefore due to your recklessness of not putting away your phone while behind wheels you can face heavy charges when it could have been prevented.

In conclusion driving with a phone present is a sure way to distract someone and possibly an accident. If that is not convincing then the accident can lead to the death of passengers or other drivers. This will result in heavy charges if deemed responsible for death. Therefore save everyone the trouble by simply putting your device away until you reach your destination or parking real quick. Concluding my argument why drivers should not be able to use a cellphone in any capacity is supported by not my words but professionals as well.",1
"PHONES AND DRIVING

In this world in which we live in, cell phones are a growing market as well as cars. The fact that we depend on cell phones throught the course of our day for numerous reasons.

Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving because its easier to operate a phone in your hand than a cell phone that is not in your hand. Emergencies can occur while driving and you need to report the emergerncy while driving. Cell phones does not cause as big of a distracHon that other things that is done while driving.

A lot of people are in an uproar about driving and using a cell phone and someHmes it is overrated. Trying to operate a cell phone with one hand while maintaining driving has no danger to it. A phone that is mounted on the holder that begins to ring is harder to operate answering, dialing and switching calls.

Most Hmes the mounHng is not secure or has defected parts which can cause more of an issue than having it to your ear. Most people have older cars and cannot a? ord to upgrade and dont have the speaker opHon, which usually allows everyone surrounding your car to know you business.

I cannot say it enough, emergencies happen in a ?ash. Driving and you see a accident that needs emergency aLenHon you need to be able to use the cell phone to call it in. Things happen so quickly now and it could be your phone call that saves their life. Also if a person is lost and no gps signal but calls can be made a person should be able to dial someone by hand and get direcHons out of harms way. Emergency is a big deal in cell phone usage.

Cell phones do not cause as much as a distracHon than people make out to be. As a driver a person should always be aware of the road and be able to mulH-task when using a cell phone. Most Hmes its other things besides a cell phone that cause a distracHon but blames the cell phone as a scapegoat. There could be test on the driver liscence test that we should take to see if were able to drive and talk on the phone instead of just banning it.

Talking on a cell phone and driving a car may be a distracHon for some but not all. It should be our call on if we are focused enough to drive while talking. Although some people are said to have had bad behavior while talking and driving some are very responsible. TexHng and driving is di? erent from talking and driving and that should be the boundary. Each person should be accountable for their acHons just as speeding.",1
"People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multi-tasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can't stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn't be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving. I also think that you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle because it can cause vehicle collisions, slow reaction time, and fatal injuries. Therefore, driving can cause many accidents that can be fatal to the driver and passengers if there is any and cell phones should only be used when not operating a vehicle.

The first reason why the use of cell phones shouldn't be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening. Most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol. When people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor car-following ability and lateral lane control. While under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisions.

As stated before, these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisions.

The second reason why you shouldn't operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction time.

Reaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus. When your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see you're about to get into an accident it would already be too late. Reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds. Reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds. On top of that, drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone. Cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is driving.

The last reason you shouldn't drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have long-term or short-term affects. The affects can be physical, emotional, or psychological. One of the most common physical effect is whiplash. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck. Whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions. One emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving. The last effect is psychological which can cause PTSD. Most car accidents are the results of PTSD but can also be caused by any traumatic experience. PTSD can affect a person's ability to function normally.

People who goes through this will sometimes show a wide range of symptoms including anger, fear, shock, nervousness and feeling of mistrust or guilt.

In conclusion, people shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle. IF they do it can cause life changing accidents and other serious problems in life. Also, it can hurt some people financially causing them to pay for these uneventful occurrences. Some things people can do to prevent is to turn their phone off or put it on ""Do Not Disturb"" mode to prevent any accidents. They can also deal with that they have to do on the phone before starting the car and driving. One more solution is that they can have the passenger relay a message for you using your phone, so you won't be distracted or tempted to pick up the phone.",1
"Texting and driving

Over half of drivers in today's society have this horrible habit of texting and driving. This has to stop immediately, texting and driving puts people's lives at risk. This simple act has caused many fatalities over that last years. Fortunately, the government have put a new law to deal with this problem with our generations problem of texting and driving. I strongly feel that texting and driving is dangerous and should be prohibited.

Diving more into detail, texting and driving is hazardous and life threatening. Just imagine you're on the road driving to your friend's house and someone shoots you a text. You look down not even for 5 seconds; then you accidents swerve into the next lane hitting a car. There are so many different scenarios that could go wrong in that situation. Your life is over just because you couldn't wait to text your friend. The consequences that texting and driving comes with just isn't worth it.

The cost of a life shouldn't be worth a text message, Snapchat or Instagram DM (Direct Message). Texting and driving has taken many lives. In a recent article I read it said ""2017 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics. In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 421,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2017, 11% of drivers under age 20 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash."" This cannot go on any longer we must do something to stop these numbers from increasing.

Luckily the government has enforced a brand new law called ""Hands Free"".

This law states Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving. If you don't follow these laws they can fine you fifty to one hundred and fifty dollars. I feel that this action was necessary and justified to better protect our society.

Over all texting and driving is dangerous, has killed many people and is now on the decline thanks to the new "" Hands Down"" law.",1
"explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle

Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones when driving because they can be severely injured or worse die. The number of crashes related to a phone and texting have made the use of a phone while driving illegal. Also the non use of a cell phone behind the wheel saves countless lives everyday.

Some states have also enacted laws to ban cell phone use. In the United States risk of automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than if they weren't on their phone.

Driving with a cell phone has been the main cause of vehicle crashes over the last decade. Which led to most states banning the use of the device completely. However One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Strong evidence that both retrieving and, in particular, sending text messages has a detrimental effect on that individual that increases their urge to use it. Although using a hands free device may sound better however in reality it's not since your attention isn't always on the road. All drivers should refrain from there cell phones.",1
"Should drivers be able to be on their phone while driving? My opinion to that question would be no for many reasons. You shouldn't have any distractions while driving. Way too many people are killed in car accidents and there doesn't need to be any other distractions while driving. Driving while using a cell phone is a vision distraction, it's law enforced, and it's a hazard to other drivers.

Any form of usage on a cell phone while being in the car is dangerous in many ways. Drivers need to sit back and think is texting or calling anyone at this very second worth a risk of taking or endangering not only my own life but risking it for any one else's.

Using a phone not only causes danger, but causes many forms of distraction and disorder. It can be physically danger in and kind of situation, it is mentally distracting depending on what the cause is, and can even become an issue not only with the protection of human but a problem with the law. Doing anything on the phone in that very moment is not worth taking anyone, yet their own life's but yet not worth getting into trouble that could've been avoided.

It's safer to have someone in the car with you, talking to you rather than you being on your phone. The passenger in the car can keep you company and keep you entertained. A cell phone will distract you and you could take your life and even someone else. Being on your phone could make you drive slower and cause other vehicles to pass you and that could cause an accident.

Drivers should not have in their possession at any time a cell phone. It's too much of a risk. There is no need for a snapchat or a game can't wait in order to not take you own life or someone else's. There is enough distractions while driving without it being a phone. A phone only makes it all worse.",1
"Everyone knows that texting and driving is a terrible idea, but only a few people seem to understand why. Using cellphones while driving is never a good mix for anyone. The generation now don't know the meaning of texting and driving. There are bad wrecks happening while driving and texting on the road. Drivers should never use their phone while driving. On your phone can really cause you to swerve off and on the road leading you to be in the other persons lane. Taking your eyes off the road has obvious disadvantages and it degrades our attention.

90% of car crashes is mostly the drivers fault, they mostly use the excuse of ""recognition error"". When you are in a divided conversation your attention is in different places like the road, a person in the car with you, or a phone call. All those distractions only one should mainly have your attention which i suggest be the road, and us as human we only have a little of attention to spare. Texting on a phone while driving can make you react more slowly to what your main focus should be on. We also feel immune to the risks of other people. Many of us have a lot of experience making bad decisions and suffering the consequences. It feels reasonable to infer that we are able to text and drive safely but some people may chose not to thinking they can do them all in any way. Remember the real reason why it's terrible to text and drive.",1
"Operating a motor vehicle while on your cell phone

Being on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life. Many people around the world are injured by this situation every day. It could lead to accidents and altercations. In addition it would even cost you your licences. The most detrimental outcome is death. There are far more outcomes to operating a motor vehicle while being on a cell phone. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

One leading cause to motor vehicle accidents is being on your cell phone. It could lead to accidents and altercations. Yourself and the passengers are more at risk to bodily injuries and harm. These bodily injuries and harm can range anywhere from mild to critical condition. In an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved. There is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone. In an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such. An direct result of an event in place; a fee or very large payment would need to be made. Secondly another consequence could be having your license taken.

When you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence. Rather it being jail time, injuries, or more. Your license will be subjected to suspension. A suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated. The process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time. The average time for a suspended license is sixty days.

For some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good. Furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phone.

After all the consequences the most detrimental is death. Many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident. Not all people pass away at the crash site, some has a condition mild to critical that causes them to die. Around 1.6 million people a year die in motor vehicle accidents. Out of the 1.6 million, 1 out of 4 pass away because drivers are on their cell phone. That includes the driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car, around, or in another car. Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations, suspension of license, and even death. Prevention is simply not being able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle. Take a moment to focus on the road.

You are able to check your phone when you reach a red light or a complete stop. This is one step closer to its prevention. It will save many lives even your own.",1
"Phones & Driving Essay

I believe that drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving because it is an attention hazzard. Driving with your phone in hand is not only illegal but very dangerous, but driving without the distraction of a phone can lower the driving fatality rates by a lot. Also, there are apps and programs on the phones that help drivers go hands free. Last, having that phone as a distraction while driving can cause a significant lowering of you reaction time and attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

First and foremost, Driving without the phone as a distraction will generally lower the fatality rates of distracted driving accidents. Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of self-control is the reason why people get distracted by their phones, especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents.

Furthermore, Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people, objects, and other cars on the road, with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident. Also, looking for pedestrians crossing while distracted just makes driving harder than it has to be.

Finally, There are various things that have been put in place to keep the driver from getting distracted by their phones, For example apps and programs on the phones that keep the driver from checking or responding to their phones. It prevents the driver from getting phone calls, texts, and other notifications while in the car. Another example, the hands-free laws that hold the people that like to drive with phone in hand accountable. Last is personal accountability, keeping yourself in check and safe but not just yourself but the people in the car with you and the other cars.

In conclusion, Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot, there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts, but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road, and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.",1
"Although cell phones have been around for quite some time, they have become a key part of our lives. We use cell phones for anything now such as: texting, social media, calls, schedule planning, etc. Unfortunately, we are choosing to use them at the wrong time and wrong place, while we are driving. As time is going by, we are getting more and more into the phones that we don't care about our personal safety or others safety. Using cellphones while driving can be extremely dangerous to the drivers and others around them for many reasons.

When we are driving it can be exceedingly difficult to focus on the surroundings around us and easy to forget that you are sharing the road with other people and not just yourself. Other drivers take notice when drivers are on their phones whether they want to or not because of the danger they can cause. Erratic driving is something that we all get worked up about because it can make us late or can be inconvenient to us. Drivers also tailgate you because they can't keep the constant speed because they are on their phones. Sometimes pedestrians are killed because people are on their phones and don't pay attention to their surroundings. We may not intend to end someone's life, but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our life.

Everyday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving. According to my research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers. Research shows that being on your phone while driving can cause the risk 4x more of a horrible crash. Because we use cell phones more often now, we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to keep in touch with people. They also think that the hand-free is a safe thing to use because they are driving with two hands instead of holding the phone.

Driving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that they cause, it causes someone's insurance to rise, and it causes concerns to people's health. I think people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others. Research has proven that people who use cell phones while driving are more prone to be/cause an accident. People who use cell phones while driving does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. It also can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that could lead to tragedy.

In conclusion, people should stop texting and driving because it can cause serious damage. Not only that it can take someone's life. Texting while driving is a serious problem today because we are on our phones 24/7 and we don't usually put it down. We are distracted by our phones to the point where we shouldn't be able to drive with a phone in the car because of how long we are on our phones. Driving and texting should be banned before we lose more people.",1
"Have you ever seen an ambulance or two with a few cop cars rushing by and thought what's going on? Many people who are caught up in these types of situations do it to themselves by using their phones, causing accidents and injury that shouldn't have happened. This needs to stop, maybe even be helped if it can't be stopped.

Many people get upset when new rules coming out trying to limit phone use while driving. This shouldn't be the case though as they are just trying to prevent any unnecessary injury. This could also mean time in jail for the driver for being on his or her phone in the first place. This again causes unnecessary problems that could be avoided. The person who was using their phone would also have to pay a fee for the damages to the vehicle or even the person.

Another reason people shouldn't be able to use cell phones all the time is because there's always a time where and ambulance is driving by or even a cop. Most people would pull to the side. On the other hand, if your blasting and unaware of your surrounding because your using your phone you wouldn't be able to hear them unless they were right next to you. This could cause injury to whoever they were rushing to get to. If it was a cop It would be bad for the driver blasting music too. Not being able to use the phone keeps you safer and out of trouble.

A way to make it somewhat safe for phone use however is to have a Bluetooth connection in the car. This is a pretty good compromise. People can just use their car to control phone needs. All calls can be answered and texts can be read without looking at a phone. This will keep the person safe and make looking at the phone less of a problem. This however wouldn't stop all problems which is why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in capacity while driving.

In conclusion driving around in general isn't the safest thing ever. Adding an extra distraction that makes driving even more dangerous isn't smart. People shouldn't be mad at laws made because people make bad decisions while driving. Laws are made to keep us safe so if a law to not let people use phones it would help stop accident and other unnecessary injuries or problems.",1
"Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. Cell phones are now starting to be a part of life using everyday technology to do a lot of stuff. Paring this and driving is not a good combination, why you shouldn't do it and how it effects people.

Drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. For example, It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst-case could kill them self or other people.

Reports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because of texting and driving. There are a lot of other reasons why not to do it to. First of you must set an example towards the passengers that are in your car rather it be your kids or you friends. Secondly its illegal in a lot of places but Texas is one of the only seven states that have yet to completely ban texting and driving. Lastly and the one that gets told a lot is that your eyes are taken off the road, A person is 23 times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while sending a text message, than if they were only driving. That number towers over the other activities associated with distracted driving.

In conclusion you should never texting and driving it is the most leading cause of death within motor vehicle crashes.",1
"Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death. The biggest age group affected by this problem would have to be teens aging from 16 up to adults aging around 30. In the end, no one benefits from this problem other than the law enforcement team who has worked so hard to stress the importance of no texting while driving and funeral homes that are being paid for burial expenses. The reason I say that the law enforcement benefit from the problem would have to be because this is an example of exactly what it is that they try so hard to avoid. Funeral homes benefit because most of these cases end in a tragic accident that allow the funeral home to prepare a home going ceremony. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person continue to text and drive. People really need to understand how easily it is take the life of someone else or even themselves. And most of the time in many cases relating to this particular problem, it is always is the age groups ranging from 16 years of age to 30 years of age. I wish that this problem can get resolved quickly to avoid many accidents and death.",1
"Should Drivers Be Allowed To Use Cell Phones When Driving?

Why Driver's should desist from using their Cell Phones while DrivingHundreds of research indicate that using the cell phone while driving is a dangerous prospect that leads to loss of lives. Statistically, 50 minutes of phone chatter while driving increases the likelihood of a car crash or car accident almost five-fold (Crundall, 2017). Texting has also emerged as an issue but many reported cases indicate talking on the cell phone while driving. In the United States, 20 states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones, while another 48 states have banned text messaging while driving (National Conference of State Legislature [NCSL], 2019). Surprisingly, no state is yet to pass laws banning cell phone use across a multitude of drivers, and this explains the continued rise in cell phone-use induced car and road accidents. The majority of drivers and motorists claims that 'being distracted by mobile phones"" is the leading cause of car and road accidents.

One major issue concerns the risk of using one hand to navigate bends and respond to potential hazards while talking on the phone. According to Crundall (2017), the majority of roads accidents in Europe occur in steep slopes, bends and corners, with 35% of them involving the driver communicating on his/her cell phone. Another issue involves the act of conversation which leads to a loss of concentration - cognitive processing - that ultimately leads to an accident (NCSL, 2019). Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University conducted a simulation study and discovered that the human spatial brain activity is affected when performing dual-task, leading to loss of concertation and hence accidents (Crundall, 2017). Processing of auditory messages becomes a problem when driving and communicating on a cell phone, explaining why a driver, under no circumstances, is required to use his/her cell phone while driving.

"Phone and Driving

Throughout the years people have lost their lives due to the use of their cellular phones. Using phones while driving could be dangerous for everyone that's on the road 24/7. Innocent people that go to work a drive every day put their lives at risk for other people that drive while using their phones. Phones should not be used while driving.

People that use their phones while driving put their lives at risk for the simple fact that they could cause an accident on the highway or even in the streets. People choose the wrong moment while driving to look at their phones and sometimes forget that they share the road with other innocent people and they turn what could simply be a normal day to a tragic ending on a person's life. Phones haven't been out for that long and we as humans can get so distracted by just looking down at your phone and not being aware of the cars around you or in front of you. Every year more people die for causing an accident while using their phone or is killed by a person thats on their phone when not supposed to.

In the U.S., 4637 people died in car crashes in 2018 due to cell phone use. Including the cost of people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion dollars. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 millions crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving , these mortality death rates are from every country that people are able to have a phone. One out of four cars accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. however , the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car accidents. On average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to people that are distracted by their phones while driving.

Ways that we can prevent accidents of people using their phones while driving is that people should put their phone on silent or out of reach. People should be able to use their phone if they are going to a certain location and they need to use their GPS. car accidents are mostly caused by the fact that nowadays teenagers have the privilege of driving around with innocent people that go to work to bring food to the table. Most teenagers know the risks that their lives could be at risk while driving. According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyways. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accident were distracted by their cell phones.",1
"Cell phones were presented within the United States showcase within the decade of 1980 and their utilization right away developed amid the following two decades. The slant of utilizing cell phones has expanded all through the world. One of the essential reasons for the tremendous development of cell phones is that they encourage communication advertising tall levels of adaptability coming to craved individuals inside seconds whether he/she is at office, domestic, or exterior driving a car etc. Cell phones back in making a coordinate contact with individuals successfully and without wastage of any time. Another fundamental reason for the hazardous development of cell phones is the security viewpoint. Cell phones make it simple to contact amid crisis indeed amid driving in spite of the fact that utilizing cell phones whereas driving is generally perilous and not fitting, it gives the comfort of handling crisis circumstance, tuning in music through hands-free, and following courses etc.

In case drivers on cell phones have more mischances, at that point drivers ought to be precluded from utilizing them. Drivers on cell phones do have more mishaps. Hence, drivers ought to be disallowed from utilizing cell phones. To create this contention, you must clarify and protect both of its premises, and they require very diverse contentions.

A few investigations recommend that talking on a cell phone whereas driving is viably like driving whereas impeded. In reality, a ponder at the College of Utah that compared tanked drivers to drivers on cell phones indeed found that ""cell phone drivers displayed more noteworthy impedance than inebriated drivers"". Ouch. A costly mineral called coltan may be a component of cell phones. It can stand up to warm and store an electrical charge. It's found basically in locales of the Equitable Republic of Congo, and the mining and generation preparation regularly includes child/youth work and natural dangers.

Eleven states have sanctioned a few sort of confinements with respect to cell phone utilization whereas driving. For illustration, Arizona forbids transport drivers from employing a cell phone whereas operating a transport. Florida incorporates a particular law concerning cell phones with headsets, stipulating that the headset permits exterior sounds to be listened through at slightest one ear. Modern Shirt does not permit drivers beneath age 21 with a learner's allow to utilize a cell phone whereas driving. Modern York's law, ordered in 2001, is the foremost broad.",1
"Phones and Driving

Should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle. According to the article ""Cellphone Use While Driving Statistics and Texting and Driving Facts"" states that according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. ""Talking or texting while driving or checking social media posts takes eyes off the brain off the task of driving"":

states a message that phones has become a distraction to the human brain, but not only distracting the human brain, but is also becoming a habit to human beings.

Distraction has become a huge part in car crashes and people's injuries. Cellphones has become an important component to many human routines. Therefore, it doesn't come to a surprise or a shocked moment that gadgets such as cellphones, tablets, or any other technology devices are ambiguous. Phones not only put the driver in danger, but also other people such as passengers and the other driver in danger.

So for that exact reason, many states implemented the law to not text while driving or you will get a big, fine ticket just for the safe of other people .",1
"I am typing about why drivers should not use phones while driving. This is my opinion and I will be backing it up. It is also a law all over the world. Not texting or being on your phone can save lives if you are driving.

I say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life.

If you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.",1
"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. A cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a wreck. People still use cell phones because they want to be available and keep in touch with other people. They think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. They use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

People whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. They can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to an injury.. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. Hands Free don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. It show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. People have proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man work, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.",1
"Drivers Should Be Limited As To When They Can Use Their Phones While Driving

Drivers who are distracted by their phone while driving have an increased risk of crashing. Crashes affect both the crasher and any possible crashing victims. Everything from physical pain to emotional pain as well as financial pain can be felt after a crash. 3,287 deaths happen every day due to fatal car crashes. On average, 9 of these fatalities are related to distracted driving. Due to the inability to test if a crash was due to distracted driving, it is believed that the recorded number of distracted driving incidents is greatly under-recorded.

Over 80% of drivers admit to not paying attention to the road while they are doing blatantly hazardous behaviors while driving. The listed activities are not always the driver interacting with their phone, however it is safe to assume that interacting with their phone is one of the many hazardous activities these drivers admitted to doing. Distracted driving is now considered to be the ""new drunk driving"" since it follows the same psychological pattern. With recent studies of phone addiction showing some of the same signs as drug addiction, people are having a harder time ignoring their phone. It is no coincidence that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.s and that 16-19 year olds have a three times higher chance to be involved in a fatal crash than any other age group while studies show that teens and younger children are the most addicted to their phones.

While it is dangerous to be interacting with your phone while driving some people have no choice in the matter. Reasons for this can range from work related texts or phone calls to family matters. Some states are trying what is called a ""hands free law"" that makes it illegal for a driver to hold their phone while they are driving. It also states that a driver cannot read or watch videos on their phone while driving. Because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages. The law along with the accessories allow these types of drivers to access their phones, though very limited, and keep up to date with their important concerns.

The hands free law and the accessories could make the open roads a little safer for everybody while allowing people to keep their phones in their car but it is important to remember that no matter how many laws are put into place, people will still continue to abuse them and accadences will still happen. It comes down to the individual and how properly educated they are and whether or not they can mentaly handle a responsibility like driving.",1
"BOOM!! You're on I-75 on the ground bleeding out watching everyone surrounding you, calling 911.

At this point you're thinking to yourself, ""why the freak did this happen?"" A couple hours later you found out an adult was on his phone texting and driving before the wreck happened, which is the most selfish thing to do while driving. Putting your life and other's lives in danger just so you can send a stupid text to your girl/boyfriend is completely selfish. I firmly believe that we need stricter phone laws to in jail people.

Texting while driving is in the top five causes for deaths, and yet many states do not have laws against it. We need to stand together united and encourage our Congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distraction.

and be mature and adult-like and discuss ways to not further endanger each other.

Cellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it, but I know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change. What's more important to you: a notification or somebody's life? Our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make the roads safer for everyone, we as people need to come together an decide what to do to make things happen, we don't know how much more accidents have to happen in order to push it into effect.

We dedicate our selves to our phones,we cant go 10 minuets without trying to see if we got a notification, the time we spend on our phones is tremendous its up to 6 hours a day! Not including the time spent in your bed! If there were something to happen to all of our phone we would go insane,if we would just make stricker laws for phone an driving the people would stop because of the consequences.",1
"I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing ones insurance to rise, and it is causing concerns to people health issues. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with the their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the electronic device. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about it also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason to ban the ususage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising.",1
"Phones and Driving

Look around you! All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.

Phones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. ""About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year"" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article ""Mobile phones and driving safety"", it stated that,""In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving."" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.

Many people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of "" Teen driver source"", ""In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.""The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on ""Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.

Both the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.

Each state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.

In conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.",1
"Imagine waking up to a call in the middle of the night saying you lost your loved one in a car accident because they decided a text was more important than their life? Texting while driving increases the risk of an accident 23.2 times compared to unimpaired driving which is a sobering statistic provided by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in 2018. Using the phone while driving has spread throughout the nation, and with people being so impatient in today's society, texting and driving has had damaging effects on people and their families. Phones have become a key part of our lives but it's our job as people to know when and where to use our phones especially as drivers. Driving while distracted by the phone can affect everyone involved physically, mentally, as well as financially.

Driving and texting is something very common, but a serious problem with detrimental effects. The main detrimental effect could be physical. When a person texts and drives, a person could cause an accident, which could not only endanger themselves, but it could endanger others.

According to the National Safety Council, ""Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year."" These are deaths added to this already hectic world that could have been easily avoided.

Not only can texting while driving affect a person physically but it can also affect a person mentally.

While physical damage to a vehicle or physical injury to a person can often be resolved in a matter of days or weeks, emotional damage may last a lifetime. Author and blogger Rebecca Goldfarb recently categorized the types of emotional damage as shock, anger, guilt, anxiety and depression and even post-traumatic stress. Goldfarb added many people who are involved in an accident as either the driver or as the victim often need to receive professional care if the difficult emotions are lasting longer than expected.

The final way in which driving while distracted may negatively affect a person is financially. According to the website big AZ BIG Media, there are six types of costs that may happen following a car accident. The first two immediate financial costs involve the repair of personal property and the costs with healthcare and medical treatment. The second two financial costs involve possible legal fees and an increase to car insurance. Finally, the last two costs involve the loss of employment (income and benefits) and the possible cost of a career change if the person cannot return to their job.

In conclusion, texting while driving is not a wise decision. Texting while driving can negatively affect everyone involved physically, mentally and even financially. Oprah Winfrey summarized this point on April 26, 2010 on her website with these words ""But this is a real problem we can do something about and get immediate results. All we have to do is hang up or switch off. It really is that simple. Once we do that, not another son or daughter will have to die because someone was on the phone and behind the wheel-and just not paying attention."" The solution is simple, don't text and drive.",1
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody",1
"Phones and Driving

Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed.

In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.

As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field (""Distracted Driving"") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.

Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .

"There shouldn't be a discussion when it comes to texting and driving for obvious reasons. It's just as dangerous as driving under the influence. And there are plenty of ways to send a message using hands free technology. It also being illegal should really mean that you shouldn't be doing it. And you can also kill someone just to send a text message. But it is common in the United States.

Texting and driving has been banned in most of the United States there are only 2 states that haven't banned texting and driving. And of you get caught by a cop you will be fined up to $400. And that is a lot of money for just sending a text. And may also cause your license to get suspended. It makes sense because when you text and drive you are twenty three percent more likely to get into a car crash. That makes just as dangerous as driving under the influence.

A lot of people don't actually know how dangerous and common texting and driving really is. It makes up eighteen percent of fatal car crashes. And more than 35 percent of teens and adults admit to texting and driving. So even though people know what could happen they still do it either way. And more then ninety percent of people know how dangerous texting and driving is. People take there eyes off the road for four seconds on average which is long enough for you to swerve on to another lane. And at least 9 people are killed every day by distracted drivers.

There are plenty of easy ways to prevent texting and driving. One way is to have your phone out of reach and on silent so if you get a message or a call you won't be able to get tempted to reach for your phone. Another way is to use an app to block incoming texts or calls. Some apps can send an auto response back, letting the sender know that you are driving and will respond when you are not driving. And one way is to be committed to not texting and driving.

In conclusion texting and driving and driving distracted is a big problem that can easily be avoided. But people still tend to do it anyways. People should pay a fine if caught by a police officer. And should get there license suspended if they do it a lot. People should be more aware about the consciences that can be caused by this petty action. To keep it simple would you drive 1 ton of pure machinery at 60 miles per hour blindfolded.",1
"Not Using Phones while Driving

Throughout the years, teenagers have been eager to turn 16. Driving is a nerve wrecking and exciting experience at the same time. There is a good upside about driving and that would be being able to go out to places without having to pay and the time period you can stay out for is how long you desire. Even though there is a good side, there is a bad side as well. This would have to be the large amount of people that are not cautious around their surroundings and many lives have been taken away due to this. I would have to agree with the idea that says that phones should not be used while driving , my reasons for this are that peoples lives are taken away, a phone is a big distraction, and it is a law you have to follow.

My first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because too many lives are taken everyday. Utilizing a phone while driving takes many lives every second of our daily lives. About 1.6 million lives a year end up in critical conditions or worse, dead. A phone call or text can wait, but being impatient can result in deaths. This impatiences creates danger to the person driving and everyone around them. Too many lives are taken by near accidents, crashes, distractions, and running of lights caused by usage of phones by operating moving vehicles. Many more lives could be safer if people chose to wait for their usage of phones after being off the road.

My second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because, too many distractions are already on the road without adding a phone as another reason. Once again, using a phone while driving creates too many distractions for the driver and everyone around is left in danger. For example, phones can create delays on stop lights which can create simple accidents. The glare of a bright phone on a dark night can actually interfere with the sight of the driver and can cause loss of control or misguidance to swerving. As well as sudden loud sounds from a phone can actually scare or frighten a driver straight to a crash. Occuping phones while driving is one of the biggest reasons for caused crashes all over.

My third and final reason for not using phones while driving is because, a new law recently has been released on how using phones on the road is no longer permitted anymore. The new law was put in to ensure more safety due to all the distractions caused by phones. Since it is a new law, a new law means that it is expected to be followed, a new set out rule. It is for the safety of people and everyone surrounding. People will get punished if the new law is not followed and in my opinion, i would say that it is one of the greatest laws forced. The new law will minimize the amount of crashes caused by phones on the road all over and save many more lives and everyone around.

A phone should not ever be used while a person is driving for any type of situation, it can wait. My reasons, once again like i said before is that many lives are taken away, it is also a big distraction, and last would be that it is a new law. A phone is really entertaining and that is something people do not want behind the wheel because then it can become a distraction.

Through the whole essay all I could come to head would be about the peoples lives taken away left with a broken down family. Phones ultimately should not be used while driving and a person should not have to double think it, before they cause a new tragedy that will leave them with a lifetime of consequences and guilt.",1
"Should drivers be allowed to use cellphones while driving?

Drivers should not be allowed to text while drive is what I believe statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teens. 12 million car crashes in 2013 involved crashes in text messages. Texting while driving show that this multitasking at least 341,000 behind the wheel is becoming more dangerous and life threatening now. Because technology will change and new distractions will be involved. According to research conducted at children's hospital teens who don't frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away there the phones while driving outweigh any drawbacks such as being able to pay attention better on the road, and being less likely to have crash and also following the law. Parents should also avoid talking to students as that can also be a big distraction for them. Cellphones aren't just about texting but multi behaviors it's about anything that can cause a distraction from the road such as social media apps , and music have the potential to draw away from the road. Cellphone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. Texting is undeniably the most dangerous thing a person can do while on the road and its becoming more and more common as the leading causes of death from car crashes are just that and intoxication. Today the majority of humans own and operate cellphones on a daily basis and that's a distraction from what they're doing and can be very dangerous when your driving because you aren't paying any attention to the road and can kill someone.

Something as simple as calling someone can also be dangerous but it's not the leading cause of death. from driver's messages and keeping your eyes on the road is and that's really a major dilemma for someone else who's unaware of that. so I believe that in the future people should always make to keep an open eye for this because it can be very life threatening.

I would consider this age the phone boom since widely now everyone has or owns a communication device and this allows for simple talking and texting time now moves a lot faster than before so people are now trying to catch up with it and that can really become distraction for a lot of people. And those really aren't safe anymore because that can cause car crashes and even death that put you and someone else at a high risk paying attention and being aware is very important you don't want be the cause of someone's death or maybe even a child's death because you were to ignorant to follow the basic law so my plan would be to limit the use of phones on the road while driving and allowing only when you are parked.

The general driving statistics on the national safety reports that that texting while driving made a dramatic increase of 1.6 million crashes an estimated year high. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

The statistics?

While driving and texting may seem not that much to worry about the death toll seems to speak much for itself. 1 out of 4 accidents and car crashes happen because texting and phone use during driving this seems to be all too common for teens in some areas because according to the AA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting which also means there aware of the safety concerns these situations tend to have people nationwide. Teens are more susceptible to car crashes the likely hood of adults they are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near crashes than adults are prone too. A teen driver who has a passenger in the car doubles the risk more than 5x likely. A cellphone use becomes a national problem there never a reason to risk your life and someone else's to get a simple text in the chances of getting into a car crash with a passenger increase don't be careless is the importance of this drive safe.",1
"Texting and Driving

Driving will always need your undivided attention at all times. There are many obvious reasons you shouldn't text and drive. You can get in a wreck, hit a pedestrian, and it puts your life at risk. Driving is a privilege and you should always follow the rules of the road. Using your mobile device can put you and the people around you in danger.

First of all, Texting and driving can get you in a terrible car wreck. When your on your phone your reaction time is bad. You can miss a stop sign and another car can come from the left or right side of you and you wouldn't see it coming. This can also raise your insurance rate up or you can be sued depending on how bad the accident is. Why risk it when you can wait or pull over to send that text? When you're looking down might not see pedestrians cross the street.

Besides getting into a car wreck you can also injure another person for being careless. Driving in a neighborhood needs your full attention. If you use your mobile device in a neighborhood you can either hit a pet, a jogger, or even a child if you're not paying attention. If such thing happens you can either get sued or go to jail for manslaughter. This is another major reason why you shouldn't be using your phone on the road.

Most importantly, getting distracted by your cell phone can put your life and other people's lives at risk. The most common deaths road deaths are caused by someone who were on their phones. You crashing can also cause a domino effect with other cars hitting each other on an intersection or a highway. That one text is not worth putting your life and other people's lives at risk. You don't want to end up in the hospital or even worse end up dead.

In conclusion, you should never use your phone while driving under no circumstances. If you need to make an emergency call, you should invest in a bluetooth hands free radio to make your phone calls. It is your duty to make the road you drive in safe for yourself and others. Make sure your eyes are always on the road no matter what.",1
"Phones and Driving

In today's current society almost everyone in the world has access or owns a cellular device. That device that can call text or email right from your pocket. While it is so very useful it can also become quite distracting to someone who might be driving. Which leads to the point that Drivers should not be able to access their phones while driving. In these cases its smart to look at the annual driver and cell phone related instances that have happened over the years as well as the averages of crashes involving phones and the driver.

Cell Phone users while they are driving are 5.36 times more likely to get into an accident when driving accordion to a study done at the University of Utah (""Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks."" University of Utah News, archive. unews. utah. edu/news_releases/drivers-on-cell-phones-are-as-bad-as-drunks/). These statistics show how more likely a driver is to get in an accident while on their cell phones. That isn't a small number 5.36 is a larger number of people when taking into account how many use their phones while driving anyways. This leads into how many people actually die to chances like these.

In 2015 alone there were 3,477 people killed in a distracted driver accident. 476 of which in those cases were cell phone users.(""Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving."" EndDD, www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoaz3BRDnARIsAF1RfLevzm7d8WG_o9fmbSLCDrfzuhq4pSz6LYGnFCL65o0N-OBsj-T8u8YaAh1_EALw_wcB.). These numbers when taking into account how those deaths could have been prevented by simply putting the phone down while driving are extremely high. That is 13 percent of all drivers that died last year were on their phones. And those people would still be alive had they put the phone down.

These statistics do not lie when saying how people die due to cellular phones being used while driving. With that when 13 percent of the annual driving related deaths are all cellphone based and with the ever growing world that number will go up. That is unless the Driver puts the phone downs while he drives.",1
"Phones and Driving

In this day in age of technological advancement, mankind has quickly adapted to using devices such as cellphones. It has gotten to the point where we constantly use it for everything we do. There seems to be many good qualities about the cellphone which humans seem to keep all are attention on. That in turn causes problems with our surroundings such as being on the phone and driving a vehicle.

There is no denying that cellphones take up all of our attention. There are just so many things that we are able to do that makers have put in it. It is just to ensure that we never get bored while also waiting for the next phone with technological superiority to be released. Likewise, with driving. It takes up all of our focus to make sure we don't get into a car wreck. In a way, driving and being on a cellphone are very similar in regards to how much attention we give it. So when putting both together, the ending result are what you would expect it to be, catastrophic.

Cellphones and driving take up a lot of focus and because of that, we constantly are switching from looking at our phones to paying attention to the road and oncoming traffic ahead (assuming there is any that is). They do not balance out well and people can easily get into car accidents as a result. This most notably happens when a person is trying to text and drive at the same time. It was this very reason why texting and driving has been made illegal to ensure the safety of fellow drivers. You would think the problems lay with teenagers doing it, but adults have a higher statistic level when it comes to this, providing more fatality rates to go up. Add that in with alcohol and there is no telling what will happen.

In the end, we just should not use our phones while we drive. It quickly turns into a habit once we start and it will not end well. It can also result in being arrested if caught by a local police officer. We should get everything out of the way before we start driving or stop and park somewhere before we engage into the activities on our phone. There are plenty of safe ways to use a phone while inside of a vehicle, we just choose the most dangerous route.

"Young adults and teens can not put their phone down for a second. Any notification they receive is so important to them. The first thing they do is check and see what popped up on their phone. The worst time for this to happen is when they're driving because they will still cheak no matter what they're doing. Using your phone while driving can cause you to get a ticket, cause you to hurt someone, and even cause you to hurt yourself.

People may think nothing of driving and being on their phone. Police always advertise to let others know not to use their phones while driving but they refuse to listen. Now if a police officer catch anyone on their phone while driving they will get a ticket. Everyone hates when authority stops them. It's the worst feeling ever and to make it worst is for the reason to be just being on your phone.

If people are driving and on their phone they're not focused on what's in front of them. Anything can pop up in front of the vehicle at any time. Things like animals, people, and even cyclist can appear in front once you up from your phone. The only problem is the driver may not look up in time and hit someone or something. There is a possibility that whoever the driver hit could suffer major injuries or even death.

Not only are you putting others in danger, you're also putting yourself in danger. Like mentioned before, anything can pop up in front of you vehicle. This time around it can be another car, truck, or even a bus. Crashing into one these just from being on a phone can possibility cause instant death. Maybe you might have quick reflexes and try to avoid collision. There is a possibility still hit something else like a tree. Some may be lucky enough to only be injured or not harmed at all.

In the end, using your phone while driving can result in you getting in serious trouble or causing harm to yourself and others. Authority can stop you if they notice it. Other citizens can harmed by you for not paying attention. Also you can harm yourself. Just do not do it because it's not worth it. It can wait.",1
"Have you ever been behind someone that has been on there phone and didn't know the light was green or when someone almost hit you because they didn't see you because they were looking at their phone?

To start things off, I believe that there is a time and place for being on your phone with behind the wheel. If you are at a red light and you don't have to type or just have to answer a call or change a song i believe that is an acceptation to the rule of being on your phone. Since we are in the time and age were we have Bluetooth in cars and can connect to our phones so it makes it easier to call and or answer calls. Texting and driving is a must stop because you may think that you will be fine and can multitask but in reality you are putting you and the other drivers in danger. No one's parents should have to attend their child's funeral because they died from texting and driving or because someone else was texting and driving. There are many reasons not to use a phone while driving but there are also exceptions to this rule now you may not agree with me on this but this to me is the best actions to do because people will not stop with getting on their phones while driving but at least we could limit it to just a few ways that they could get on it while being behind the wheel.

Secondly, with technology still evolving in this day like now they are getting driverless cars that may be the next big step in the world of vehicles. Now with these cars we don't need to worry about the needs of driving cars if there is no steering wheel.

Every day about 11 teens die due to texting and driving in the United States but with today's technology they are trying to help stop texting and driving but everything we do doesn't seem to be helping and or stopping teens from texting behind the wheel. Some people still might not agree with me on what I believe is important but if you just give it some years maybe just maybe it may be possible in today's society that no one can get hurt from texting and driving.

Lastly, although it's a big problem for people to stop texting and driving, it's not a ban in every state in the United States. It's said that only 39 states put a ban for novice drivers because it isn't the biggest deal for some people to be able to text and drive which I know doesn't sound great but it's kind of the truth in a way. I personally have no experience of this because I can't drive but i see people who do drive and do this and it's not like it's every time it mainly at red lights you see them doing it. Now out the 39 states 20 of them ban it for school bus drivers also.

It's taken the USA almost 14 years and people still don't listen to no texting and driving.

To conclude, have you ever been behind some or seen someone texting and driving? I got to tell you some facts that maybe you didn't know about texting and driving and even I learned something new. I also gave some changes that could happen in the near future that could change how we see texting and driving.",1
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become mandatory in most of our lives. Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways.

Driving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family.

I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states -- Arizona, Montana, and Missouri -- insanely do not have laws against texting while driving.

According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives.

In conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. I Think you can wait to answer that text.",1
"Don't Touch the Screen

As we drove to the final basketball game of the season against our rivals Milton High School, I was having a great time with my best friend. Paige and I were stopped at the intersection on Highway 9 when a white SUV crashed into the back of her Nissan Rogue. We were both rushed to the hospital where my friend learned that her leg was broken in two places. Paige could not finish the rest of her swim season and was absolutely devastated. We later found out that the driver behind us was looking down at her cell phone and didn't notice that the light had turned red. The driver's one second of distracted driving affected my best friend's life for months although, thankfully, her use of a cell phone did not end it. As a result of the risk to the public, drivers should not be allowed to use handheld cell phones while operating a vehicle.

Operating a vehicle requires attention and focus. Anything that interrupts a driver's concentration leads to a dangerous distraction. Three main types of distracted driving are visual, manual, and cognitive. Drivers who text and drive, snap and drive, instagram and drive, or simply call home while driving are endangering the public. Texting while driving is particularly harmful because it combines all three types of distracted driving . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers who send or read a text while driving lose concentration and take their eyes off the road for up to five seconds. Those five seconds of using a handheld cell phone are a great risk to the public.

Statistics show that using a handheld phone while operating a moving vehicle risks the welfare of the public. In ""Cell Phone Use and Driving,"" Louis Hugo Francescutti states that using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of collisions four to six times, and drivers are twice as often to be in a rear-end collision. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nine people are killed each day, and the public is involved in more than one-thousand car crashes due to distracted driving. Francescutti writes that researchers believe that distracted driving causes twenty-five to ninety percent of car collisions. Clearly, these statistics demonstrate the danger of distracted driving.

Although distracted driving causes over four thousand deaths each year, there are solutions to this tragedy. One obvious solution is not using the phone at all while driving; however, other possible solutions include the use of bluetooth and phone mounts to decrease the number of deaths. Since driving requires attention and focus, making the choice not to use the phone while driving limits the risk to the driver and to the public. When absolutely necessary, the use of bluetooth and phone mounts can offer drivers phone access while still protecting the public. These two alternatives should only be used in case of an emergency.

Clearly, operating a vehicle while using a handheld cell phone is dangerous. Georgia recognized these dangers and passed legislation to prevent the use of handheld devices when driving; however, some drivers fail to follow the law. The driver who caused my accident received a citation for using her device while driving. Hopefully, the next time she goes out on the road she will think about the danger to others and act responsibly.

"Phone & Driving

According to the National Safety Council reports cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. 390,000 injuries occurred caused by cell phone use and driving. Nearly 6,000 pedestrians are killed because of this as well. Phones should not be used while driving not only because the dangers that occur but also because the people that are harmed or killed, and it could've been prevented.

It's rare that the driver ever gets hurt. It's always the person they hit or they've caused a lot of damage. Cell phones are a huge distraction while driving a vehicle. Your not paying attention to the road in front of you because something has caught your eye below the dashboard. Something that could've waited until you arrived at your destination. Sometimes you have to ask yourself is it really that important?

2018 an estimate of 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. Cell phone use while driving resulted in 3,000 to 6,000 people getting killed or injured each year. All because someone couldn't leave their phone leave for awhile. Now they have to deal with people's lawyers and insurance company. Just everything that could've been avoided. Creating unnecessary problems for yourself.

May 29, 2019 a new law was created. It prohibits people driving to not use their cell phones. If a person was to disregard this law. The result would be paying a $50 fine for first offense.

The message doesn't have to be answered right way. If it's that important pull over.

You shouldn't text and drive or use your cellular device while behind the wheel. Doing so will result in someone being injured or killed, paying a $50 ticket, or even worse. Don't use your phone while di=riving, it can wait.",1

"Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become a key factor in many lives today. People tend to use cell phones for just about any and everything. As a people, we tend to rely on our phones at any given moment. Since the invention of telephones, society has been using phones for texting, talking, social media, etc. For those uses, cell phones have put us at risk. We tend to use or cell phones when we are walking across the street, and most importantly when we are driving. Operating a car while texting/talking results in the driver becoming a hazard to other drivers on the road.

Firstly, there is no doubt that we are addicted to our phones. Our phones have led us to be distracted. A distraction is something that prevents someone from giving their full attention to something else. For instance, when we are driving, we hear our phones ring and instantly we pick it up to answer. It is the inner use telling us that we are amazing drivers, and that one little call will not distract us from the road. In all reality, one little phone call does distract us from when the light changes, or when someone needs to get over to the other lane. Cell phones reduce driving performance.

As well as that, drivers have to operate both the phone and the car, which leads to car accidents. Using the cell phone and driving the car at the same time, reduces the drivers ability to concentrate on the road. All it takes is two seconds to look down at the phone, and the next thing you know, you have caused a life or yours. Car accidents are well known in the community to be caused by texting and driving. Not to mention, being on the phone and driving-slows down reactions to traffic lights and other traffic events, which also causes car accidents. Equally important, during bad weather on slippery road, engaging in conversation equals to paying less attention to the road increasing fatal accidents.

Although, there are negative impacts of texting and driving, it could also be beneficial. The beneficial parts could consists of using it for emergency purposes. For example, calling for assistance on the side of the road, reporting an incident while driving, or simply calling for help. In addition, cell phones can be used for navigation to an unknown destination. Cell phones always provide you with information about news, weather, and alerts for any city you are driving in.

In conclusion,it can be concluded that texting is not only an effective way of communication, but always a safety concern. Different studies have shown that many accidents are caused by phones and driving daily. Phones and driving is a dangerous habit people have picked up on. How many people are going to have to get hurt before realize their actions have consequences? We have to understand that phones and driving is extremely dangerous, and has to be stopped.

"Phones & Driving Essay

Most humans have that habit of attending to their phone when they receive a notification while driving. They are so anxious to know what's going on right there at that moment. But they have no idea of how much danger they are putting themselves & others in! Using a phone while driving can wait. Here's why!

First, you can't multitask & pay attention to both a phone & the road at the same time. If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps.

Second, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So therefore, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that.

Lastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence. Just think about it.

Those are my reasonings for advocating that phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle. It's a high risk & dangerous. But hey, it's just my opinion!",1
"Phones and Driving

Phones have become an essential of human lives, 68% of Americans own smartphones. Some people use it for entertainment and others use it for education and work, but it can also be distracting because people can not put it away even while driving. Nearly 40,000 each year are injured or killed due to a phone caused car crash in the United States. Even though phones can be devastating, they can be used to contact emergency authorities during a crisis on the road, on the other hand they can be hazardous when used for any other reason like calling, texting, or anything else related to looking away from the road.

There is a four second interval between a phone related car crash, a phone rings the driver takes their eyes for at least two seconds to find it, then they answer it before looking back on the road, at this point it can be too late to prevent a fatal crash. The drivers sense of sight, hearing and hand coordination are temporarily lost. Driving is a serious and dangerous task, all attention should be focused on the road, so the individual can drive safely for themselves and other roadway users.

Using your phone while driving is basically like closing your eyes and taking your hands off the wheel. The driver can potentially harm roadway users around them like pedestrians, bikers, truck drivers, and motorcycles. According to the Association for Safe International

Travel, ""Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44.

Each year nearly 400,000 people under 25 die on the world's roads, on average over 1,000 a day."" Many of the crashes could have been prevented if drivers had full attention on the road.

Some of the newer cars are fitted with the handsfree mode where the driver connects their phone through bluetooth. This helps drivers decrease hazards if it is used properly, and there are now cars with autopilot. It helps to put your phone on do not disturb mode or putting it somewhere requiring you to stop and safely use it. Many states are now passing a strict no phone policy in cars, like Georgia if a police see a driver with a phone in their hand they can now be fined.

People have to become more responsible while in the cars, they should always remember to wear seatbelts, use their phone only when there of the road and parked somewhere safe. If used correctly phone can be useful for emergency situation on the road, but they can also be a danger for the individual and other people around them if they are used incorrectly.

"Phones and their impact on driving

Phone use while driving has become extremely common in this day and age. Almost everyone that's driven a car has done it, and they know it. A lot of people do it, but that obviously doesn't make it right. Of course lots of things have come out so that we won't have the phone in our hands while driving, but who said that having a phone in your hand is the only problem? Phones cause for distractions, accidents, and possibly even jail time.

The last thing that you want while driving is to get distracted. I think I could say the same thing for a passenger. Have you ever been in a car with someone and they start looking at their phone?

Have they ever got on the phone and laughed so hard that they close their eyes while driving? It's not a good feeling to be in a situation such as that cause you worry about your life. Hands-free calls are good but just because they don't have a phone in their hand does not mean a person still cannot get distracted due to the use of a phone.

Distraction due to phones could result in multiple things. One of the things it can result in is pedestrians getting hurt. In the state of Georgia, Pedestrians are given the right-of-way when crossing a marked crosswalk. Pedestrians are required to yield the right-of-way to oncoming vehicles when crossing the street without a marked crosswalk. If drivers aren't paying attention then they might just hit a pedestrian and it might just be on the driver. Drivers could be so distracted due to cell phones that they run a stop light and end up hitting a pedestrian.

One of the main reasons for car wrecks in the United States is not driving under the influence or speeding. The main cause for car wrecks in America is distracted driving. People don't realize how easily a person could get in a car wreck. Looking at a text or notification on your phone could take your eyes off the road for almost 5 seconds. 5 seconds doesn't sound like a lot of time but it really doesn't even take a full second for a car wreck to actually happen.

When using your phone while driving, you should ask yourself a few questions. Do I want to possibly go to jail today? Do I want to possibly crash today? Do I want to possibly take a life today? These are questions you should ask yourself before picking up that phone and reading that text or even talking to someone on the phone. Don't be selfish. Think about other people and the impact that using your phone while driving could possibly have on others. Put the phone down and get where you need to go.",1
"PHONES & DRIVING

In today's day and age, technology has drastically increased. People now days seem to rely on their devices more than anything. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They look at the phone while walking, eating at a dinner table, or even in class while their supposed to be learning. But the main problem that is occurring is people texting on their phone while driving an automobile. This brings up the question if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In my perspective, I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving. For starters, you're taking your eyes off the road. This is extremely dangerous because it only takes five seconds (minimal amount) of your time taken away from the road for an extreme accident to occur. For example, if u is driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.",1
"Should People Use Their Cellphones While Driving?

Over the year many states have banned using cellphones while driving. Some people tend not to listen and still use it and that causes a lot of people lives. Should people use their phone while driving? No one should be using their cellphones while driving. It's not safe for you, the person next to you, or the person that you hit, insurance rate goes up, and its illegal.

People thinks that they can use their phones while driving but end up causing people lives even themselves. In 2018 half a million people were injured because of texting and driving. In an article of ""Facts & Statistics About Texting & Driving (Updated for 2018)"" it claims ""With the latest statistics available as of 2018, in 2015, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Transportation, 3,477 people died and another 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes caused by drivers who were distracted because they were texting or using cell phones."" Don't let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the roads.

Depending on what auto insurance people have, when you get into an accident your insurance will go up. In an article ""Just how much does car insurance go up after an accident?"" it said that ""Insurers once followed the Insurance Services Office's (ISO) standard of increasing a premium by 20 to 40 percent of the insurer's base rate after an accident."" If you drive a brand new car that you pay for it, you wouldn't want your insurance to higher then your car bills. Specially if you are a young adult trying to figure things out, you will be making the worst mistake if you let your phone have your attention.

In most state it's illegal to text while driving. There are 41 state that ban texting while driving because of distractions. In the article ""Texting While Driving May Be Common, But It's Illegal In Most States"" it stated,

""In all but four of those states, texting while driving is a primary offense, meaning you can get pulled over and ticketed simply for that alone; in Florida, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio, you can get ticketed for texting only if you were pulled over for some other offense, such as speeding. (By comparison, only 12 states, along with Washington, D.C., ban all drivers from using handheld mobile phones.)"" Don't get distracted and get pulled over because your friends or family is texting you. If anything it only takes a minute to pull over and do what you need to do. You don't want anything to happen to your safety.

Life is too short for anyone to risk it. Witnessing a distracted driver is very scary, life is never promised for tomorrow. Rethink about your choice, is it that important to risk anything? People are way too naive to know what's right from wrong, moral of the story don't text while driving.",1
"Today, there are many controversial conversations on people using their phones while driving. Some People may think that phones should be allowed to be used for certain reasons such as GPS and other emergency uses while others believe that phones should not be used at all due to accidents and law violations. If people were able to use their phones and be a responsible driver at once, just maybe there would not be a problem with it nowadays.

Even though phones have caused a lot of accidents and deaths, I believe that certain uses of the phones should be allowed while driving. Sometimes, people get emergency phone calls and emergency text that they need to see in order to try and fix the situation if it is a fixable situation. Some people also have their phone for uses of GPS and other informational services. Not all people use their phones as a distraction while driving. Some people just need it at the time.

Even though i believe that using your phone while driving is a good idea, there are many cons to this idea. A lot of car accidents had to do with the involvement of teens and adults using their cellular device. Phones have cause a lot of deaths, not just in America but across the world. I believe there should be more laws made that does not ban phones but put restrictions on them like time restrictions. Example: A law that prevents you from using your phone after 8:00 pm or a law that prevents you from using your phone on certain streets.

All in all, i do believe using your phone while driving is not that bad of an idea as long as people can use it responsible while driving.",1
"Cell phones. Almost everyone has them but over the past couple of years have they became a issue where they have caused peoples life's. Many people find the time to be on there phones anywhere at anytime they want including while driving. People have been putting each other in danger just to see a text or a notification while not paying attention to the road this simple action can cause a person to lose there life.

Image a teenage girl first time on the road and is finally able to have her freedom and rights of driving. The girl is driving carefully and responsibly until she gets a notification from her boyfriend saying ""we need to talk"". The girl hesitates to answer the text message while she is looking back and forth from the road to her phone until she finally grabs the phone from the cup holder. She started to text back her boyfriend while running a red light and getting T-boned on her side of the car causing a crash. This is just one of the million possibility's that could happen while texting and driving. This is also a reason as to why under no conditions should a person text while drive. What if the girl didn't pick up the phone? What if instead she turned it off or pulled over onto the side of the road. A text message will be there forever but your life dose not.

Not only are you putting your life at risk but you are also putting other peoples life at risk. For example there's a man driving a truck and just got a text message from his wife he figures that since there is no one on the road nothing bad would happen so while he is texting while driving he dose not notices a boy riding a bike crossing the street he looks up from his phone and realizes whats about to happen and steps on the breaks on time. What if he didn't stop on time what if he kept texting. his actions did not effect him but it effected others such as that little boy. This is why for no reason should you text call or face time while drive it dose not matter how you do it you are still putting other peoples life at stake including your own.

In conclusion drivers should never text while drive because you are then putting your life and others at risk. If only drivers would think before they do something then maybe more people would be alive today. Maybe the girl in the car crash would be alive today maybe the boy riding his bike would be alive today. Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. You are not only driving for yourself but for everybody. A text message can last forever but your life will not.",1
"The use of cars and mobile technology has done nothing but grow in our society without ceasing. However, the use of these cellular devices while driving can be fatal to the driver and to others. If the driver is overly distracted and is not paying attention, it can cause them to veer off the road or hit innocent, bystanding, pedestrians. The use of technology could also be used for good. GPS helps most people on this earth, get to where they need to go. Although, this can also lead to them getting distracted, some apps have it, so that the driver can simply hear the directions. The usage of cellular devices shouldn't be restricted completely, but limited to using GPS.

The amount of car accidents due to drivers being distracted by their phones, is at 1.6 million per year. This is mostly texting and driving, or being on social media while operating a vehicle. Actively using phones while driving should be restricted because of the danger to the driver, passengers, and the pedestrians that are around. Most of the drivers that are making these mistakes, are teenagers that don't know better. Teen drivers, or new drivers in general, should take a proper drivers ed class, that'll teach them proper drivers etiquette. This will inform them of the dangers of texting and driving, and teach them techniques to avoid temptation.

Although the use of cell phones should be restricted, it shouldn't be completely prohibited. Drivers often use their phones for GPS in this day and age. If phones are permanently prohibited, then drivers won't be able to use their mobile map. It navigates the driver to where they need to go. Apps have been programmed so that drivers can use their GPS hands-free. They also input a feature that will speak the directions out loud so the driver doesn't feel the constant need to pick their phone up and read the directions. All the driver has to do is input their destination in before the vehicle starts moving. Phones while driving doesn't need to be prohibited.

Some people will argue that the usage of any phones can start any car accident. While that is true, it is highly unlikely and implausible. Although texting and driving is the cause of many car accidents, it's not the cause for ALL of them. Phones cannot be blamed for every car accident that happens. In fact, drunk driving is the cause for 31% of car accidents that occur in the country. Taking away the cell phone completely from use in the vehicle, will have a poor effect on the drivers who need GPS to go to new places and don't end up lost. It will lead to drivers needing maps, which are often hard to read and hard to keep track of.

Getting rid of cell phone use while driving completely, may seem like a smart idea at first, but it doesn't make sense once really contemplated. It would alter the country's way of driving, and not in a good way. Maybe there would be less accidents, but there are still drunk drivers to worry about. Cell phone usage while driving should not be strictly prohibited, but rather restricted for all uses except for GPS.",1
"Cell phones and vehicle operation are simply two things that do not mix. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Research Shows that using cell phones while driving nearly doubles the risk of a negative outcome occurring. As mediocre as that sounds it could lead to fatal car crashes, Injuring a pedestrian or even punishment for distracted driving.

According to Edgar Snyder & Associates Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". The outcome of texting while driving is not that important to where lives should be taken to send a text if it's that important then why not just pull over. in the article on edgar Snyder & Associates it also states that 10 percent of all teen motor vehicle crash fatalities in 2016 involved distracted driving. The risk is increasing every time a person pulls out there cell phone.

In the article that was posted on USA Today it stated that ""U.S pedestrians death totaled nearly 6,000 in 2017 for the second straight year amid signs that walkers and distracted drivers do not mix.""Also it states that texting while driving is more risky in a urban environments. Teens that text and drive are more likely to get into an accident than an adult that is even though both are risky studies show that being young while doing it is worse than being older while doing it. The issue at hand is affecting everyone texting while driving or just being on your phone is a bad mix and innocent children and adults are suffering because of it.

Texting while driving can result in many punishments like Monetary fines, Criminal charges and jail or prison time. According to Legalmatch ""Texting while driving is a moving traffic violation and may be a criminal misdemeanor in certain jurisdictions"".

Also,Jail or prison time if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. The more you get caught texting and driving the worse the punishment will be it could start off with a simple fine and the next time you could be serving jail time. Finally, If you have been hurt due to someones else mistakes you are entitled to compensation at which you can sue them.

In Conclusion, Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The outcome of this can hurt the drivers mentally, physically and even emotionally (if they take someones life in the process).Texting while driving is now one of the most reason drivers are getting fined as technology advances peoples urge to use their cellphones are growing tremendously. It is not worth it to risk your life for a flash of entertainment that isn't going anywhere anytime soon there actually incorporating technology into the vehicles.

Phones & Driving Essay",1
"Phones & Driving

Driving with a cell phone is very common, yet very dangerous at the same time. This is because phones tend to cause a distraction among, not just teens, but adults as well. Driving with phones have become so crucial, it has become against the law to drive with a phone in hand. The leading cause of teenage deaths in America are car accidents. The fatal crash rate for teens is three times greater than drivers ages twenty and over. Having phone in hand while driving has made for numerous unfortunate deaths for people. The main cause is not being focused on getting to a destined location before picking up a phone. The situation has gotten so severe, the Apple company( made for iPhone), has taken matters into their own hands. They have created 'do not disturb' to detect when a person is in a moving car at certain miles per hour, to keep them from having any distractions as far as notifications or calls.

There have been inventions made to lessen the use of phones while driving, so as the phone holder and using bluetooth connected to a car. Though these things are helpful, it still can be a distraction while driving; as far as maneuvering to answer a call and inserting a phone into a phone holder. Driver distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. After reviewing this information, it's more favorable to not use a cellular device at all whatsoever while behind a wheel. By putting the phone down and taking small steps toward safe driving, even if it takes pulling the car over, will help lower crash/death rates around the globe. In conclusion, phones and driving do not coincide well, and should be prevented no matter what the cause is.

"Essay 2: Phones & Driving

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because, that's a detraction on the road. If you have kids in the car and you texting while driving and you do not pay attention to the road and your coming on to a traffic light and it's red a car is in front of you, and then you hit the car you could kill you and your kids just from that one big detraction on the road. Say if you lived and you kids died you are going to jail and you have to go to court to pay the people who you hit from behind that one mistake could lead to all of that. Anything can and could put your family in risk and you in risk for your life. You're driving in your car so someone who you know or love text you. A person walking across the road you're not paying attention at all you hit them they lived lucky lived when you hit them, so they stay in the hospital a good 2-3 weeks the police come to the hospital convince the person you hit to sue you they do it. In the mail or the police that convince they person that you hit come to your house and tell you that you have been sued for texting and driving on the road because the traffic lights has a camera on it catches you. Your court day comes up either your license get suspended or you have to pay the person you hit money. It might end up as both. This why people should not text & drive.",1
"Today in society cell phones play a huge part in deaths because people use their cell phones while driving because they want to text, call, take pictures, and or even being on social media. As people continue to depend on cellphones for their communication needs these devices not only become more useful but also more dangerous, especially when people are using their phones at the wrong times. The most dangerous time to use your phone is when you are driving. If you use your phone while you are driving, you are taking a huge risk on losing your life or taking someone else's life. The action of many countries around the world to ban the use of cell phones while driving may have served to deter drivers from using their phones as they drive.

One of the main reasons that make using cell phones while driving very dangerous is that using the cell phone reduces a driver's reaction time in traffic. On busy roads, the amount of time that one talks before reacting to a situation in most cases determines whether someone gets to continue living. It is very dangerous to text and call while driving but texting while driving is more dangerous because the driver must constantly keep looking at the phone screen in order to type or read the messages. Studies show that people who text while driving tend to accelerate more slowly after stepping on the brakes, this can cause irregularities for another driver leading to possible accidents and since their eyes are more on the text than the road, drivers who choose to text while driving have a much higher chance of hitting a pedestrian than those not distracted in driving.

Many accidents, whether severe or not, usually occur within a blink of an eye. This means that just a moment of distraction is enough for a driver to cause a serious road accident. Given the many concerns, it is best if drivers were not only banned from texting but banned from their phones in any way at all as they drive.",1
"Driving while on the phone

Driving while being on the phone is very dangerous. No one should be operating a vehicle and using technology. It can ruin your life. People don't think before they do stuff and it doesn't always end good. You might think you can pay attention to the road and drive at the same time, but you never know until its too late. Many wrecks have been caused by people texting and driving. You could look up at the road one second too late and take someone's life.

Most teens are addicted to their phone and right when it buzzes, they grab it and check it. They can't even drive without them. You could swerve while on your phone, stop too late, or never see the person walking. Just like that someone's hurt and its your fault. Driving is a serious thing. You don't have to just worry about your life but the other peoples on the road's life too. Not everyone can see the same thing, so all your attention needs to be on the road.

That's why you shouldn't drive and be on your phone. Its very dangerous and can take someone's life. You never know when that day will be. You can never be certain on what will happen. That's why you should always be safe and not do it. Think before you take someone's life.",1
"Phones & Driving

Before cell phones were invented car accidents were shockingly low compared to the numbers we see today. Texting and driving are six times more likely to cause an accident than driving intoxicated. Over 1.6 million crashes a year in the US are linked to cell phone distraction. There needs to be something done to stop this.

If someone is caught texting and driving, there should be a worse punishment than a small ticket. People are putting people in danger every single day doing this. Approximately 660,000 people are using their phones right now while driving. Texting and driving are considered the most dangerous activity to do while driving. Nearly 390,000 injuries a year are caused from texting and driving. Texting causes a 400% increase of distraction while driving.

Even people that text and drive want something to be done about it. 94% percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving, and 74% of drivers support a ban of hand-held cell phone use while driving. A AAA poll showed that 94% of teen drivers know about the cell phone laws and the dangers of doing it, and 35% admitted to doing it. 21% percent of all teen accidents are caused by cell phone usage. Teens are 4 times likely to get into an accident or a near miss than an adult when talking or texting on a cell phone. 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving in 2017. 15,341 people between the age of 15-29 have been involved in fatal accidents involving cell phone usage.

There is too much risk involving cell phones and driving, thousands of people die a year involving cell phones. If something can be done about this then many lives would be saved. Teens and adults put themselves and other people in danger every day just to look at a screen for a few seconds. Someone's life is more precious than taking your eyes off the road to look what someone said.",1
"Drivers should absolutely never be able to use a cell phone while driving. This is evident as in recent years there has been a big problem in our society with drivers using their cell phones while driving. It has gotten so bad that it has become illegal because driving while using a cell phone is more likely to be the cause of a fatal accident, than when a person drives under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Use a hands free device at all times while driving. I say this because a cell phone will take your attention off of the task at hand. A driver's focus should be maintained on only driving to ensure safety. It has been proven that driving while using a cell phone is the cause of more vehicular accidents resulting in a fatality than those caused by drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

In two thousand and thirteen there were three thousand one hundred fifty-four people killed in distracted driver related crashes. In just one year's time, there are three hundred and ninety thousand people injured in accidents caused by texting and driving. I personally do not use my cell phone when I drive, because it distracts me very easily. I suggest that drivers should be able to use their cell phone for an emergency purpose only. Even in a crisis situation, the driver should pull over to the side of the road before making a call.

I also encourage that the cell phone companies should be made to have the cell phone come from the factory to where if your cellphone is moving, it will not be allowed to ring or give you any notifications. In order to get your notifications, you will have to manually tell your cellphone to read that you are not driving for it to allow you to open the phone. It will then give you the notifications and or missed calls you have missed. In addition, it will not allow you to access absolutely any of your social media platforms or let you get social media notifications while you are driving.

In conclusion, my opinion on whether drivers should be using their cell phones while driving is that they should refrain from using their cell phone while driving. This is because driving is a task that requires a lot of focus and a cell phone is very distracting.

Driving while using a cell phone is now illegal because of how dangerous it is.",1
"Did you know nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year?

Losing your life over having a cellphone in your hand or trying to respond to a text that can wait is not worth your life. It is not that serious to ruin someone else's life and yours to send a text back to your homeboy saying your on the way. Stop signs maybe but while driving of course not.

Using your cell phone on the road is nothing to play with. Driving without a phone in your hand is hard enough. You have to focus on your surroundings and other people driving is hard enough. I think I can speak for everyone when I say stuff can happen right before your eyes. That means as soon as you look down to send a text back to your girlfriend you can be in a ditch or through a building as soon as you look up. I feel like there should be more technology that can help people use their devices on the go. But the way it is looking now in the world it does not need to be addressed at this moment.

Moving on, I feel like people should not be able to have their phones active while driving. And music should not be played loud enough to where they can't hear the outside world. Personally I don't like how people do that. It is dangerous to others and themselves. But more phone laws should be introduced because that is way too many deaths to be comfortable with. I don't want to be known at my funeral for being killed all because I was texting a friend.

InConclusion, phone laws are looked over in the country today. If we want to cut down on these deaths we need to take action on the little issues that are called cell phones.",1
"Most of are population use phones on a day to day basis. We use them every were when we are at school, at a family dinner, we even use phones in the car. Is it safe to use them in a car though. I believe that using your phone in the car can be safe at times but also be life taking another.

I feel like they can be safe at time because using it at a stop light while your waiting i thank is fine. I think it's all about the time and place you use your phone. Because if you need your phone for an important phone call you will most likely pick up the phone where you are at. This could be safe because that important phone call could save a life. If you didn't answer your phone something whose could of happened.

I believe that it could be life taking because going down the highway going 60 and running into someone would be pretty bad for everyone. Another place that using your phone at that is dangerous would be when there in a intersection or in traffic because looking at your phone for a second you could already hit someone.",1

Drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle, because there are several risks that could happen. For instance insurance rates will hike. Also, you are more than likely to have a wreck. Lastly, if there are people in the car you should always consider your passengers.

Your insurance rates are priced by a complex equation (Rate factors) which include: Age, Car make and model, Gender, Location, Driving history. Causing a car accident often leads to higher insurance premiums. Even if your rates don't go up after an accident, you could lose your good drivers discount.

Many of us want the right to text and drive in our cars, but study shows that texting while driving causes accidents. For the people driving older cars, texting while driving is a safety hazard. It's Now Illegal to Text while druving, due to the many accidents. Overall being distracted in any way makes you a worse driver than you would be if you were completely focused on the road. Also, talking to passengers can affect you driving skills, even though it's socially accepted and nearly unsafe.

Texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk to. That's because, you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. If you were to hit someone while texting and driving, more than likely you will end up in jail.

The best way to end texting while driving is to educate, especially our teenagers. Depending your age, you might already be considered a risk. Teens pay the highest insurance rates in the country, followed by the elderly seniors. Teens or seniors who cause minor accidents rarely get a break from their insurers.

Cellphones are becoming some people's addiction to the point they risk there life just to text. I think the only way you should be able to use your phone and drive is if your handsfree using it. Calling and music should be the only thing you should be able to do. There is no excuse to risk your life or anyone else's life just for a text message.

People are way too caught in their phone that they need to put it up when they drive. Georgia has passed a law stating your phone can not be touching you when in your vehicle. You may not even make a phone call unless your car has the hands-free option. I honestly think this is the perfect for people. It helps control people and make roads safer.

I believe you should be able to listen to your music on your phone when driving and even make calls, but texting should be off limits. You have to look at your phone to long and take your eyes off the road which is extremely unsafe this should be reason enough not to do such things.

In conclusion, its simple to not text and drive because you're safer you could just listen to your music or if you really need to tell someone something you could just make a call to them instead and be a whole lot easier and safer.",1
"Cell Phone Usage while Operating a Vehicle

Many states have made the use of cell phones while driving illegal due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls and texting. Many states have also created laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. Cell phone usage has become the leading cause of distracted driving. Drivers can easily become distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car accidents. I agree with cell phones being banned while driving.

I believe that driving while using a cell phone should be banned because of the drastic increase in accidents. On one occasion, my mom was hit from behind because the person in the car behind her was texting on a cell phone. Fortunately my mom was not seriously hurt because the driver behind her was not driving at a high speed. If the driver in the car behind my mom was driving at a higher speed, my mom could have been severely injured or killed. Banning cell phone usage while driving enables a driver to remain focused and to keep the appropriate amount of distance between vehicles.

A driver can't focus on the road or other vehicles while consistently talking or texting on a cell phone. Studies have proven that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents.

Cell phone usage while driving has caused car insurance premiums to increase. My mom's car insurance increased an additional $15 a month this year. That additional $15 can go towards gas to get us back and forth to school, work, church, etc. Her car insurance agent advised her that rates have increased across the board; distracted driving was the main reason for the increase. I earned my learner's permit this year. My mom is afraid to teach me how to drive because of her fear of distracted driving. I will be attending a defensive driving school to learn how to drive. My mom is not looking forward to adding me as a driver on her car insurance because her premium is going to increase drastically.

She often complains about distracted driving contributing to higher car insurance rates. I don't bother my mom about teaching me how to drive for now; she takes me wherever I need to go. I'm about to graduate from high school, and it is my intent to attend college or go to the military. I have to learn how to drive very soon, but I'm really not looking forward to it.

Society has become more connected to cell phones more than ever. Cell phones provide a lot of convenience. From communicating with relatives and friends, checking emails, paying bills, taking pictures, recording videos, listening to music; you name it! However, talking or texting on cell phones while driving simply don't mix and has become a huge issue in the past few years.

Everybody has their own opinion regarding cell phone usage while operating a vehicle, but I believe that using cell phones while driving should not be allowed. Using a cell phone while driving has the driver focusing on the phone instead of the road. This increases the time it takes for a driver to react effectively. In case of an emergency; the driver should pull over in a safe zone and then call for assistance. The main reason for most car accidents in today's society is driving while using a cell phone.

I urge my family, friends and anyone reading this essay to take the ""AT&T It Can Wait"" pledge against distracted driving at ""www. itcanwait. com"". ""Join the millions who have pledged to drive distraction free.

There are three types of distractions, visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions cause you to take your eyes off the road, manual distractions are anything that causes you to take your hands off of your steering wheel, and cognitive distractions are anything that causes you to take your eyes off of the road. Throughout the years, over 3,447 people were killed by distracted drivers. Drivers 20 years old or younger are more susceptible to falling into the ring of distracted drivers. With today's advanced social media platform a new and dangerous trend surfaced the web and went viral. The creators of the app ""Snapchat"" added a filter to the application that allows users to track their mph speed. This filter promotes distracted driving.

According to the Washington Post, Christal McGee, an 18 year old, was behind the wheel of her father's white Mercedes, on her way home from work on a Thursday night in September 2015, when she pulled out her phone and opened Snapchat. McGee wanted to try the filter out, so McGee, then accelerated some more, reaching 113 miles per hour on a suburban road outside Atlanta and the speed limit was 55. She didn't see Maynard Wentworth, an Uber driver just starting his shift that night, until it was too late. She hit him at 107 miles per hour. Wentworth suffered a traumatic brain injury and was hospitalized for months. McGee was sued and the infamous app was also sued for negligence.

The accidents and lives taken could have been easily prevented and still can. Drivers are encouraged every day to put their phones down when they drive to prevent accidents, but they do not take them seriously. A death of someone at the hands of a distracted driver could easily prevent many deaths. The choice of responding to a text message or saving someone's life should be of no ignorance. As of July 1st, Georgia's Hands Free Law was passed to keep cellphones out of people's hands as they drive.

If drivers' hands and eyes are not on the road at all times because they choose to be distracted by a cellular device, then proper precautions should be taken to keep them off the road.",1

Many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although, this may be a norm in our daily routines, some people risk their lives by using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. By doing this, people can cause a hazardous driving experiences for themselves and others. The dangers can include, distractions that cause car accidents, property loss or even death. With the potential that phone usage and driving can cause so much harm, it should be a legal band to cease all cell phone usage while driving.

In 2018, the state of Georgia adopted the ""hands-free"" law. This law doesn't allow the phone to touch any part of the body while driving a motor vehicle. This means that any touching, texting, calling, dialing, reading emails, surfing the internet, recording, etc. are all banned while driving. Doing any of these activities cause distracting conditions that are dangerous and unsafe and can result in the driver straying, losing control of the vehicle, or crash.

According to NHTSA, 3,166 people died as a result of distracted driving, in 2017.

With this understanding, nothing on your phone is worth that much of your attention.

Death is a real possibility if the law is not taken seriously. In Georgia, there are about 4 accident related deaths per day and nearly 1,500 fatalities per year. A quick glance at your phone or taking your eyes off the road for as long as 30 seconds, can escalate to a lifetime of regret, pain, and sorrow for yourself or someone else's family.

This reason alone, should serve as enough rational to band cell phone usage all together or maximize the cost of fines for offenders of the ""hands-free"" law.

In the event, that there is an accident that is caused by violating the ""hands-free"" law or distracted driving caused by phone usage, it has unforeseen financial damages, as well. Although, insurance is meant to protect us, it's still at a cost. Each year it cost about $230.6 billion to United States residents for accident claims. This can place a heavy burden on any family that is under prepared for life's unexpected turns.

In conclusion, there are so many things in life that we cannot control that can result in financial burdens or death, we should ask ourselves is answering a text worth my life? I'm guessing its not but so often, we risk our safety to do just that. Not using the phone while driving is a behavior that can be controlled, especially, if we consider how important life, focus, and finances are. If we take the time to put the phones down while driving we can ""arrive alive.""",1

In today's society many phones have become an essential part of life. We use our phones everyday to talk, text, share pictures/ videos, and to use gps locaters. Although we are on our cell phones daily for various reasons there is a time and a place to use them. One time you should never use your cell phone is when operating a motor vehicle. The use of a cell phone can lead to many fatalities that can harm you or others.

Texting while driving can be distracting, dangerous, and can lead to a accident. Picking up your phone for even a second means that your attention is not on the road and can lead to a fatal even deadly crash. Texting while driving is a manual, visual, and cognitive distraction. Taking one or more hand off the steering wheel is an example of an manual distraction and not having both hands on the wheel can lead to you not having complete control over the vehicle. Not having your eyes on the road is an example of a visual distraction and can lead to you crashing into something. Lastly, texting and driving is an example of a cognitive distraction because you are not focused on the road.

Taking your eyes off the road can lead to a horrific accident that can cause harm to yourself or others. You should always be considerate of others around you whether its passengers in the car or pedestrians around you. Distracted driving means that while you aren't paying attention you could be crashing into someone and possibly taking their life. When looking down at your cell phone you aren't able to pay attention to what's going on around you nor will you be able to see a pedestrian. Will you be able to live with yourself knowing that you were the reason someone's life got taken away from them because of you?

In todays technology there are many alternatives to texting and driving. Cars now have wireless Bluetooth where you can answer the phone with a click of the button on your steering wheel. You can also speak your text messages so you don't have to look at your phone and divert your attention from the road. Even if you don't have a car with Bluetooth cell phones now come with a hands free feature and a do not disturb while driving feature. Manufactures are making it easier and easier to drive safely while also still being able to communicate effectively and efficiently with others.

In conclusion, texting while driving can be extremely dangerous and should never be an option. It can lead to accidents and will distract you from the road. Once you take your eyes off the road you are not only putting yourself in danger but others too. There are too many new alternatives if you need you use your cell phone while driving therefore the percentages of deaths due to distracted drivers should not increase.",1

Drivers should not use a phone unless they are using it as a navigational device to get to a destination. If used in any other way it is very dangerous and will cause serious accidents to them and other drivers as well. Driving while using cell phones cause major problems that could've been avoided if they weren't using a phone. According to statistics in 2018 9 deaths and 1,000 injuries per day have occured due to distracted driving

One problem that cell phones cause while driving are swerving off of roads while driving at high speeds. Swerving could cause other drivers to have accidents because they tried to avoid the person that was swerving. If they weren't on their phones that probably wouldn't have happened.

Another problem is self proclaimed accidents. Some reasons this happens is because the person was probably texting while driving and they took their eyes off the road. This is the most common problem that people have mostly among teen drivers. It is 6 times more likely to cause an accident if someone is texting and driving that driving under under the influence.

Playing video games on cell phones while driving is another problem because people often like to have some type of entertainment while driving. This could often cause road rage while they are driving because something probably happened and they got mad. Some app developers have started making video game apps that blocks a person out of the app while they are driving.

All of these problems that are caused by cell phones can be avoided if people use their cell phones wisely. Improper use of cell phones put their lives and other people's lives in danger. A cell phone should be used for specific reasons only if not then they should not be used at all.",1

On a daily basis the majority of people use their phone. Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phone while driving. Using your device while driving can cause car accidents, injure people, or even cause death.

Drivers should not be able to use their electronic devices while driving. Using your device while driving can endanger people's lives. People might make the excuse that they need to use their phone to use google maps but they could have done that before hand. Using a device while driving puts everyone around you at risk even yourself. One out of every four accidents are caused by texting and driving. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving

"Cell Phones and Vehicles

In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones at all while in a vehicle. I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving. So with these laws it should make the chance of accidents less possible, and police can write tickets so people are less likely to do it again. Now, all new cars are able to have bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have a very old car that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

However, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it's not that easy for the police to catch them.

With bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays. Many people tend to think it's not a big deal to just swipe -it takes only a second. I do think so as well. That one second could cost you a life or somebody's life.

What can stop drivers' using cell phones while driving?

The simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once ""Restriction on cell phones while driving"" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.

I will follow the law once I start driving and hope all the drivers consider about the risk of using the cell phone while driving.",1

Texting and driving is something common a lot of people do now a day. There are so many problems with cellphone usage while driving. Many people think it's okay to use their phones while driving, but I personally think it is not okay for people to text and drive. Some people rather risk their life's than to be careful about their surrounding and how one car accident can cause so much damage all because that one person wanted to be on their phone. It doesn't just have to be texting it can be in general by just being on your phone. People get way too distracted by cellphone usage.

Cellphones make a big impact on people, who knew that cellphones can be that addicting. It doesn't matter where you are you turn your head and you see someone on their phone because it is so addicting. It almost like having a coffee addiction. When you see people crossing a cross walk you insatiately see a phone in someone's hands and half of the time there not looking at where there going they just walk and walk until they run into somethings. Cellphones are a huge addiction in today's society for everyone including teenagers. You see cellphones almost everywhere you going. You will be shocked about how many people use their phones a day.

When you're driving and you're on your cellphone is really risky. It can cause many problems as in you cashing into someone else or you can go off the road and get in an accident. There have been many different accidents because people want to be on their phone and not focus on the road. Texting and driving can many deaths as well. People die of being in car accidents when the driver is texting. People don't look on the outside of how many tragic thinks can happen in a blink of an eye. It can be life changing too because you never know what can happen or go wrong. Many people don't know how much damage can happen. People die, vision lost, no arm, no leg, an arm, etc. none of this is replaceable but every material thing can be. That's what people don't understand. People need to be careful of their surroundings and, be careful who you have in the car.

People have habits of looking at their phones once they hear a ring. They right away have to go see what it was or who it was. That's where the distraction comes from and that were people get into trouble with officers or car accidents etc. because they get distracted by the ring of a phone. There is always pros and cons about things people being on the phone. Some of the pros are if you have the sound on it is always good for important in the case of an emergency. You always have something on the side or if someone else calls you and it is an emergency. Some of the cons is that people use it for other purposes which is to text, snapchat, twitter, Instagram etc. and they think they can multi task but some people can't. That's why it's better to put the phone down and let social media wait before there is an accident.

It's better to save your life and some else's.

Being safe is one on the most important things. A text message or video call, snapchat, Instagram is not worth you in bad conditions or you causing a death to yourself or to someone else. Phone are becoming to be more addicting by the day and you would be shocked about how much technology has gone up. Keep all eyes on the road never look down and stay focus.",1

I believe that despite the good that comes out of phones, they also have some serious cons when it comes to driving. 11 teens each day die due to using their phone. Not only are you risking your own life while operating a vehicle while texting, you're also putting other people's lives in danger. Using your phone while driving is a distraction no matter what the situation is. You also never know if the person in front of you could suddenly stop so having your phone out could lead to an unnecessary crash. There are a few reasons why cell phones shouldnt be used while driving. There are just so many dangerous things that could happen that are associated with the use of a cell phone and driving.

Driving decreases the amount of attention you have on the road which increases the amount of crashes. If you are driving 60m/h your car is moving 16 meters per second, so just a few seconds that you dedicate looking at your phone could result in a serious crash. Just reaching for an object like your phone is just as dangerous. The act of a conversation is also still a distraction. The act of a conversation creates a depth of though which takes away from the attention you should have on the road.

Luckily today we have things like apple carplay which you can use for urgent situations which reduces the amount of accidents. Over all, phones should not be used while operating a vehicle and if the situation is so urgent then it's safer to just pull over and take care of the situation. Doing that will reduce the amount of crashes each year. If we learn to prioritize the amount of things done while in a vehicle then it will save so many lives. We all need to understand the real dangers we put ourselves through along with other people while using our phones or any sort of technology while operating a vehicle. Technology has a lot of pros but many cons when it comes to driving with another distraction.",1

In my opinion, while you are driving you should not be able to use your phone. You are putting your life in danger as well as others. Phones are a big distraction while driving and if you don't have some type of bluetooth system in your car then you should not be on it. Cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands.

Holding a cell phone to your ear, or having your eyes diverted from the road by logic and common sense the driver is distracted. If an emergency maneuver or emergency braking is needed a driver has a second to react, and a split second to execute the appropriate maneuver to avoid a collision. Picture doing this with a cell phone in your hand. Those who are caught will be issued a ticket by a police officer who will probably be quite perturbed at the driver's ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident. A text message that reads ""ok"" isn't worth a couple hundred dollar fine.

However, people shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.",1
"Phones and Driving Essay

All around the world people are constantly trying to decrease safety risks. Driving has become one of those risks to safety. Since cellular phones have grown to be popular. People often use them everywhere and in their car is no exception. At first this was great. You could be on a work call while you were on your way home. Or you could be checking to see if anyone else wanted food where you were eating at. Although this has brought much convenience, utility and entertainment. It also has brought great risk to safety while driving. Drivers become distracted and make more mistakes than usual. Causing more accidents. There is a big discussion over whether you should be able to use your phone while driving or not. I believe that phones should not be allowed to be used in cars.

One reason that cell phones shouldn't be allowed is simply because you can last the car ride without using it. With the exception of an emergency of course. If something is important than you can pull over and make a call while getting gas or something. And everyone would be better off paying less car insurance. Also, if you have kids and display that you don't value safety, then they may follow and do the same and even worse.

Another reason is that it puts everyone at risk including themselves. If everyone was on their phone while driving. We would probably have close to double the amount of accidents. Just for a little convenience. Studies show that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol.

Humans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles, making the likelihood of seeing a pedestrian much less than that of a car. And hitting a ton car is different than hitting a pedestrian. The pedestrian would likely die if you were going fast enough.

In conclusion, simply because the downsides outweigh the upsides. You should not be able to go on your phone while driving. Because of the distraction that it causes. ANd its impact on our awareness of our surroundings while driving. It's a safety risk and for the most part only has downsides. From hitting cars to hitting pedestrians, the risk is not worth it as it puts many lives at risk.",1
"Texting and Driving

In the society of today, everyone is easily distracted when they get a notification on their phones. Which can lead to some funny stuff like running into a pole or a wall. But it can also lead to the end of someone's life.

The average person drives 70 mph on the highway, and if a person were to look away for 5 seconds they would have traveled 102.7 feet. That is more than a quarter of a football field. By that time anything could've happened that would lead them to an accident. Each year, over 390,000 accidents caused by texting and driving leads to severe injuries such as broken bones, neck and back injuries, traumatic brain injuries, etc. For example, in 2013 a 22 year-old man named Alexander Heit flipped his car and rolled for a while. He died while typing a text to his friend.

Because of all the deaths and injuries caused by texting while driving, most states in the United States have made laws to try to make the road a safer place. The first offense you will be charged with a misdemeanor and can get a ticket that ranges from $25 to $50 and one on their driver license. And it just gets worse from there on out if they continue violating the law. But if you were to kill someone while texting and driving, you will be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter and can spend up to 20 years in prison. Although all of these precautions have been made, accidents are still growing.

The states of Missouri and Montana do not have laws to regulate texting while driving even after all of the accidents caused by it. I honestly think that there should be harsher laws for people texting while driving. It so saddening to hear that someone lost their life over a text that could have waited till later. Something needs to happen so that all of these deaths stop.",1
"Cell Phones were invented in 1973, however, they weren't owned by the public until the 80s. Phone usage grew quickly after the first two decades, and now over half of the world population owns a phone. Considering cell phones haven't been around for a long time, they have become a main part of our lives, and we rely on them for simple daily activities. The growth of cell phones could be from how easy it is to reach someone within seconds no matter their location. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: phone calls, sending text messages, emails, surfing the internet, and performing other tasks. But unfortunately, many of these daily activities also occur while a person is driving. As a result, there's an increase in accidents and fatalities because of the use of cell phones while driving. Cell phone usage while driving should be banned because it's a distraction, causes erratic and aggressive driving, and is the main cause of accidents.

While driving, total concentration and procedures are needed, and using a cell phone compromises the focus needed. When driving both hands should be kept on the steering wheel because it has been proving more effective. However, when you're on the phone you don't have both hard on the wheel. Even though some people use bluetooth headsets it still affects your attentiveness. Using a phone while driving causes drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, their minds off the road and the surrounding situation, and take their eyes off the road.

When driving you shouldn't have any distractions such as cell phones, because they can cause a change to your driving pattern.

Because using a cell phone while driving is such a distraction, it can cause the driver to drive erratically. Being on the phone may cause the driver to fail to give the right signals, miss road signs, or respond slowly to situations. These patterns can be very treacherous to others driving and pedestrians. Cell phones can also change the drivers' behavior depending on the conversation or what the driver is doing on their phone. Drivers experiencing emotional or stressful conversations may behave more aggressively, possibly causing road rage and accidents. Even though most drivers believe they can multitask, many of them are getting distracted and their driving patterns are changing, causing them to have accidents.

Many accidents are caused by those using their cell phones while driving. There are about 1.6 million accidents caused by phone use, which is roughly six times more than accidents caused by drunk drivers. In 2011, it was reported that 23% of all car accidents each year involve cell phone use. The National Safety Council reports that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the

U.S. is caused by drivers using cell phones. Leaving about 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by being on the phone while driving. Cell phone use causes many accidents because of the distractions it causes and should be illegal to use while driving.

Cell phones have quickly spread and became a major part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything, making us rely on them heavily. However, we are using phones while driving, which is causing an increase in accidents. Phones cause distractions and could change the behavior of the driver. Because of cell phones being used while driving there have been about 390,000 injuries each year. Therefore, we should ban drivers from being able to use their cell phones.",1
"Do you feel that it is safe for someone to have their phone while driving? I believe that that there are reasons why you should and shouldn't be able to have your phone while driving. For example one of the reasons i believe that driving and being on your phone is dangerous is that many accidents can be caused. By that i mean when being on your phone you have no time to pay attention to the road. When driving your attention should be focused on the road at all times when looking down on your phone you can't tell who or what is coming at you, which is a easier way to cause you and or someone else to be injured.

Another reason i believe that it is dangerous for you to be on your phone and driving is because this is now another way to get arrested. By this i mean now if you're riding with your phone in sight the police is liable to arrest you. By doing this you're risking your freedom. Not only are you risking your freedom you're also putting others in harms way. By this i mean what if someone is walking in the cross walk and you happen to be on your phone and accidentally hit someone then not only is that more charges but that's also you injuring an innocent bystander.

There are also good reasons why you should be able to have your phone while driving. For example when going to a place and not knowing the directions your phone has a built in navigation system to help you get there. You don't always have to have your phone in your hand you can buy the stand where your phone can sit on that way you can see both your phone and the road.

So it isn't always bad having your phone while driving.

Another good reason to have your phone while driving is because what if there is an emergency and that is the only way someone can contact you, you don't have to hold your phone you can always get Bluetooth and or wireless headphones. By doing this you are preventing accidents from happening and your also preventing yourself and or anyone else from being in danger. Not only that but you are also able to focus on both the road and the situation that may be happening.

These are the reasons why i believe that having your phone while driving is both a good and bad thing. There are many more reasons why but these are my main three. By stating these i hope that people take caution while using there phones while driving. Now that reasons are listed i hope that people look out for themselves as well as others.",1
"I think we all can agree that driving is an important part of life. Driving is what gets us from point a to point b. We drive vehicles on a day to day basis. It's what gets us to and from our jobs. The downside to driving is that it is becoming unsafe. There are so many people in the world that dive cars and own cell phones. The population is growing which means more and more cars are hitting the road every day. So, the question is, how can we make driving safer?

New laws are being created on cell phones and driving. One of the familiar changes is that now you can't be touching your phone at all while driving and it can't be in your lap when driving. Some say they don't like this new law because it means they can't check their phones for emergencies. The law didn't say you couldn't keep it in the car or their glove department. So basically, that problem is solved. I think this Law is fine how it is and that it is a good law to cut down on cell phones and driving. People shouldn't be able to see their phone while driving. It should be somewhere in the car out of their eyesight. That way they won't be tempted to text while driving.

Texting and driving can get both people killed that crash into each other.

You could be driving and doing nothing wrong while another person is texting and driving not paying attention to the road and they could end up ending your life.

Texting is not the only problem with having a cell phone on you when you are in a car. Some people say they use their phone for navigation. This could also be a distraction. Many phone companies have touched down on this problem. In fact, the newer model phones now can speak the directions to you while you're driving. That way you won't have to look down at your phone.

People often like to bring up that sometimes they get important calls while driving. There's also a solution to this problem to. When you are receiving a call, you can pull over to the nearest stop and then receive the call. People then like to ask what if you are on the interstate. There is no law that says you can't pull over to the side and make or receive the phone call. So, yea you should be able to use your phones while driving but keep note there is a right and wrong way of doing this. If you need to use it and you just happen to be driving, please use these techniques to drive safer.",1
"Ever since phones have entered into the world, it has since then become a part of a person's everyday life. With such an important impact that helps what people do in all fields of work, it is no surprise that people use phones wherever they go. Another important inclusion in a person's everyday life is a car, which is also used by people everyday, though cars have proven to be a lot more dangerous than a phone if a person is not paying attention to the road. Many accidents have happened as a result of people not paying attention to the road and this is exactly where a phone comes into play. As previously mentioned, phones are a part of a person's everyday life, and with that much involvement with a phone it often tends to follow people to them while they are driving their car. When people are on their phone while driving, their chances of getting into an accident greatly increase. Though it may seem harmless at first, operating a phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should not be allowed.

""Car crashes happen every minute of the day"", according to the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA). According to Teensafe, ""Distracted driving accounts for approximately is 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities...58% being teens."" Ironically, teens use phones more than adults as they are more involved with social media websites and apps. Teens, unlike adults, are also more inexperienced at driving, making the act of them using phones even more dangerous than adults. With all the things that people have to pay attention to on the road, it is almost impossible to do both at the same time.

""Sending or reading a text causes drivers, on average, to take their eyes off the road for five seconds,"" according to Teenlife. Anything can happen in one second when a person's eyes are not on the road, imagine what could happen in five. Whenever a person uses their phone, their chance of being in a crash increases by twenty-three. There are three types of distracted driving and texting fits all three types which is visual, manual, and cognitive. Using a phone causes a person to take their eyes of the road, take their hands off the wheel, and to take their mind off of the road. Because texting can become all three types of distractions, it's arguably the most dangerous action to participate in while driving.

Once again, phones have become a major part of the human life, and as a result, people constantly use their phones. Whether it is to check a text or watch a quick video, it is very dangerous to even attempt this while in a car. Operating a phone or any brand or size should not be allowed while operating a vehicle. Using a phone while not driving is not safe and has proven to be deadly. Hopefully, people will learn not to text and drive and be safer on the road.",1

All in all, driving while operating a phone should be discouraged, because it endangers the lives, it's illegal, and it impairs judgement.

When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of passengers, pedestrians, and yourself along with fellow drivers. The damage that's caused from a single glance can be irreversible. Some physical effects the driver, passenger, or pedestrian may sustain are cuts, burns, bone fractures, and internal organ damage. The physical effects can be very traumatic, but not nearly as traumatic as the psychological effects. Although not visible to the eye, the psychological effects of a car accident can interfere with a person's daily life. The individual may experience anxiety, depression, behavioral changes, and PTSD(www. askadamskutner. com). These make simple task such as driving, socializing, and sleeping seemingly impossible, which can last a lifetime.

In this modern era, the popularity of mobile devices cause impairment to one's judgement while driving.

As adolescents become more reliant on technology, so does their strong need to multitask as well. Many believe multitasking benefits one to become more efficient and accomplish more tasks. Although this sounds good in theory, the outcome can produce multiple errors. The constant shift of attention causes drivers to keep their eyes off the road, which leads to constant pullovers. In addition, the driver can exceed the speed limit and not be able to see stop signs or traffic lights. This will lead the driver into an unwanted accident and cause confusion and delay among drivers.

In conclusion, one should not text while driving because it jeopardizes the lives of others, it will get you in trouble with the law, and impairs one's judgment. Such reckless behavior will only make the driver feel nothing but everlasting guilt and regret.",1

Many people claim having a phone while driving isn't dangerous. Nowadays accidents happen due to cell phones. We live in an age when many of us are excited by a call or text that we can't wait to answer. Texting while driving is a hotly debated topic that often divides opinion. It goes without saying that driving with a mobile phone is one of the most important issues facing us today. The following essay takes a look at both sides of the argument.

To start with our population on reasons why accidents happen are because of cell phones. First of all, it is worth considering that phones shouldn't be allowed on peoples hands while driving. Secondly drivers must have their phones on a phone holder to prevent getting pulled over and prevent an accident. Thirdly you must be focused while driving if you have passengers on board because you're putting their lives at risk. Therefore you shouldnt be holding your phone.

Another factor to consider is not just your cell phone but anything that distracts you like food, advertisements etc, can cause an accident. Last but not least that text or call can wait.

According to experts, more than 3,000 teens die to texting while driving. Research has found that driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk drivers. There are those who argue that phones should be allowed while driving. For example if an emergency occurs and someone is trying to get a hold of you, you would need your cell phone to stay in contact. Another example is if you are lost you can call someone for directions. There is always a solution to everything like having a car holder and putting gps rather than calling someone.

Although most drivers are in the age of driving, teens aren't supposed too. Teens have led to one of the reasons accidents happen. Despite the fact that they aren't supposed to be driving they are very irresponsible. On the other hand, adults are supposed to teach their kids the right way to drive, to always drive focus never look at other accidents deals in the street while driving always look ahead. However teens should drive with an adult past 7 pm.

As far as im concerned, we should always drive with a phone holder to prevent an accident. From my point of view accidents happen due to several other reasons but mostly because of our phones. Weighing both sides of the argument people have their own opinion on whether or not cells are distracting. My opinion about cell phones while driving is very dangerous, we shouldn't be allowed to grab our phones while driving. Now in georgia it's illegal to hold your phone, part of a sweeping hands-free law. Also to be careful on the road, you might run someone ever, you never know cause most people j walk. Whenever you go out on your car remember to put your phone on mute.",1

Over the years technology has done nothing but advance forward with time. Resulting in two of many of society's most used technology; automobiles and cell phones. Cell Phones were created to make communication a lot easier, as well as mobile. So that one could easily contact or be contacted anywhere at any point. With vehicles it was somewhat the same deal, Find an easier, and quicker way to travel. Individually both inventions are credible to society, but is it safe for drivers to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? No, it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.

In order to use a phone your eyes, hands and attention must be on the device, looking through apps or sending messages can be very distracting while driving. Distracted is one thing one should not be when operating a vehicle, distracted driving can result in an accident which can either seriously injure or kill someone. When it comes to accidents caused by distracted driving the numbers are higher amongst teen drivers. In this generation teens are addicted to their phones and social media, it is harder for them to find a disconnect even when driving. ""In 2017, nearly 40 percent of high school students reported texting or emailing while driving."" ""Distracted driving is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents. In that same year, distracted driving was cited as a major factor in 3,477 traffic deaths."" These statistics further prove how a cellular device should not be in use while driving a vehicle.

While using a phone when driving is extremely dangerous there is an alternative to using a device while operating a vehicle, bluetooth. Some people who have business related occupations may already have a bluetooth earpiece, but car manufacturers are now including bluetooth systems inside their cars. This feature allows one to connect their phone to their car, so that they can easily answer the phone by clicking a button on their wheel, and the car can read out sent text messages. One can respond by using voice typing, this allows people to easily answer phone calls and text messages without having to physically take their hands off the wheel. Minimizing accidents caused by distracted driving, talking on the phone and thinking on how to respond to a message can still be distracting and remove focus from the road. Therefore, even using the Bluetooth feature can be a cause of an automobile accident.

Overall, neither phones or alternative phone systems should be used while operating a vehicle. It is too distracting and the effect of one simply answering a text or phone call could be their or another driver's life. All phone calls, text messages, and photos can be answered and liked once the destination has been reached. It is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.",1
"Having a device near you while driving is very dangerous and a huge distraction. There are many consequences if you get caught driving with a cell phone. It distracts you from paying attention to your surroundings and you could hurt yourself or others around you. It is also against the law.

The U.S department of transportation reported that cell phones are involved in 1.6 million vehicle crashes each year. It has caused half a million injuries and around 6000 deaths annually. Texting while driving is even more dangerous than driving while under the influence of alcohol. People should put their devices down and focus on the roads and surrounding cars.

Everyday around 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving. It only takes 3 seconds for a crash to occur after a driver becomes distracted by their cell phone or anything else. Holding a device while driving slows their reaction time by 49%. Car wrecks have killed nearly 32,999 people yearly and injuring around 2,239,000 people.

As of July 1,2018, in Georgia the ""hands free law"" was passed. The ""hands free law"" means that drivers will no longer be allowed to have a phone in their hand or supported by any part of their body. Texting while driving is highly illegal and it's good to see the state's law being put in to action.

We should not text and drive. It is overall a distraction and could lead you to death or you could kill an innocent person. The laws are very strict about texting and driving now. It's good to see the cops pushing the law so hard on people and if you don't listen then you suffer the consequences.",1

Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things a driver can do. It can cause major and serious wrecks. Why do people wreck when texting and driving ? The people who text and drive do not concentrate on the road or their surroundings.

Texting and driving is so common for causing most teen wrecks. Teens are new to driving and have little to no experience. Adding a phone to the mix is just a recipe that will cook disaster. It's not just new drivers who wreck from texting and driving its new ones too.

Everyone who texts and drives is putting themselves and others at risk. If you wreck due to texting and driving you will be held liable. Many people who text and drive can end up killing the other person they get into a wreck with. Ask yourself before you go and pick up your phone if it's worth the risk.

In most states it is illegal to text and drive. You can receive a big ticket if you get caught texting and driving. Bluetooth started being introduced into cars in 2011. Bluetooth helps drivers answer phone calls without holding the phone. In conclusion, texting and driving is illegal and should not be done.

"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Every day, people die in car accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. A message or a phone call can affect how much attention a driver pays to the road.

Every day, people die in car accidents because of the usage of their cell phone. According to research cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents today. But, despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to always stay in touch with other people.

Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to a car crash. For example your boss calls and it's not a good conversation and you eventually get upset. This 1 conversation can lower your driving ability that 8could then lead you to lose control over the vehicle and cause you to crash. So if drivers don't make a decision to put away their phones, their routine can harm innocent people.

My opponents may argue that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free technology doesn't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and it may make it worse. Research show that using headphones can be as dangerous as holding a phone because conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road.

In conclusion, if people don't give up cell phones, the number of fatalities on the roads will continue to increase. It is the drivers responsibility to not danger their and others people's lives.",1

Driving while using your phone shouldn't be allowed. There's people who are more afraid of getting hit by a distracted driver than getting hit by a drunk driver. Even though they are making new laws to help distracted driving it's not enough to solve this problem. People break laws all the time just because you make the one touch rule doesn't mean it solves the problem. Now the day enforce this rule and start finding or revoking people licenses.

The dangers of distracted driving are very high. This is a serious matter people are dying every day because of distracted driving. 3,166 were killed by distracted drivers driving in 2017. At Least 9 people are killed every day, and more than 1,000 injured daily from something as little as a phone. I would expect a bigger cause to so many deaths; people don't understand that driving while on the phone is like the butterfly effect. One flap of the wing and it could destroy someone's life.

Driving with a phone could destroy someone's life in a matter of seconds, you can destroy your own life in a matter of seconds.

Driving while on your phone can ruin your life in a matter of seconds. More than 481,000 drivers are currently using their phones while driving. Even though there's all cellphone ban in 21 states and one touch only ban in 48 states people still use their phones. Two seconds is all you need to crash your car no more or no less. It's that easy and people don't realize that a snap of the finger you could be dead. It takes two seconds to not see that motorcycle or two seconds to not see that child crossing the street. Even if you yourself are not injured you can really do some damage to a person that's not in a car. You have protection of your car the person walking has nothing, but themselves.

People need to wake up and stop smelling the roses. What will it take? How long will it take for you to change your ways? What will it cost you for you to realize that putting your phone down for a 10 min drive vs putting your own life or someone else's life down for ever is more important. Not even one tap should be allowed because that one tap can also cost lives. People should have their licenses revoked for driving while on the phone. This is no accident this is manslaughter; it's an accident that could be avoided. 8/10 times a call or text message is not that important that it costs death/injury.",1

When it goes off whenever they're driving whether it's a text, social media or a call, curiosity gets the best of them and they feel as if they have to look at that very moment. To stop and read this message you would have to take your eyes off of the road longer than the time of the one second, it takes to look at the rearview mirror. It is very dangerous to type or read while driving. It isn't safe on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.

I think that the use of a cell phone while driving should be banned in all states because it is already against the law in some states, it is a distraction to drivers. The use of cell phones, in all ways, while driving is already illegal in twelve states across the country. If someone is caught using their phone while driving, drivers may be faced with a ticket and a fine. The first California cell phone law bans any cell phone or wireless phone use while driving and if you are under the age of 18 you are banned from using a hands free device. The cell phone laws do not affect passengers of the vehicle; this law only applies to the driver of the vehicle.

Handheld cell phones can only be used if there is an emergency. Cell Phones and Driving In today's society we've all become attached to our cell phones. it does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be banned and against the law.

First with texts, social media and any written phone alert.

"Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years because almost everyone who drives has one. Cell phones are use in cars more than there suppose to. In my opinion you shouldn't be able to use cell phones in a car and heres why.

1 reason drivers should not be able to use a cell phone is because they want pay attention to the road and they could hit another car or even a person. Also if drivers don't use a cell phone why there driving they can make it to there destination safe and they can get on it when there done driving. Drivers who use cell phones put a lot of people in danger cause there not checking there surroundings and pay more attention to there phone then the road.

A lot of car crashes are caused by cell phones because people are always on them. Also when people are driving they should put there phone on do not disturbe or in driving safety mode until there out the car. If drivers did that there would be less crashes and we wouldn't have to worry about cell phones.

There would be less crashes if people didn't have a cell phone in a car because the driver would be focused not only on the road but focused on there surroundings to. Cell phones make a huge different in the car then not in the car and people should juss forget about them till there done driving.",1
"Phones & Driving

The first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. When people use their cell phones on the highway or on a city road, their driving tends to become pretty lousy. Examples of this are shown in various ways such as someone pulling out in front of your vehicle, not letting you merge into an adjacent lane, the driver ahead of you slowing down to text or call, and not acknowledging other drivers and pedestrians at intersections and parking lots. When a driver slows down to text or make a phone call, they are taking their attention away from the road, which is one of the most common ways to end up in an auto crash. No text message or phone call is worth a rude action on a highway or city road much less an auto accident. It is not good to use a cell phone while driving because it can cause you to not let another car merge into a lane, pull out in front of another vehicle, slow down, and for a few other reasons too.

The next reason why it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive is because committing these actions causes more automobile crashes, as my other discussions have already indicated. Why is this? It is because using a cell phone while driving distracts the driver causing him/her to look elsewhere. Some may be attempting to dial, text, or talking on their cell phone, but nevertheless it still distracts the driver. Because of this distraction, drivers are more prone to end up in an automobile accident. Just as if a distraction might cause you to lose a point in a tennis match, a distraction on the road could cause an automobile accident. Another reason why not to use a cell phone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are less dangerous. For example, the earpiece is a device that fits on your outer ear as you might have guessed and allows you to have both hands on the steering wheel while you answer a call. With the push of a button, a call can be answered while you can still be driving safely. In conclusion, you should not use a cell phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, and because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answer calls or texts when you are going shopping, to work, to a friend's house, or whatever you may be doing, consider the consequences. What is more important? The text message or your life?. If you are pulled over texting and driving, you will be issued a fine. However, if you are texting and driving and you cause an accident, there may be criminal consequences for those actions that could result in jail time. Nowadays, there are many apps available to drivers to deter them from texting while driving Something very important is that many of the states have started to pass some laws that order drivers to stop texting while driving. However, we need to be sincere: none of these laws will be effective if we as a society don't understand that texting while driving could have terrible consequences, not only for us as drivers but also for other innocent people. I don't think that answering texts is more important than the lives of other people; texting can wait until drivers arrive at their destination.",1

In 2018 there were 4,637 deaths caused by distracted drivers. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, it increases the risk of accidents, causes deaths, and overall the act is irresponsible.

Well, Iets say you're going out of town and you need to use the gps? Most cars nowadays use modern technology, and there's a thing called Bluetooth. Having the option of Bluetooth in a vehicle allows a phone to connect to a car wirelessly. Which would ultimately allow distraction-free gps. Cell phones are helpful, but can be highly unsafe, while operating a vehicle.

Is Bluetooth actually any safer? Setting up Bluetooth can be as easy as one, two, three. Look for your cars manual and it should have directions on how to set up bluetooth from your phone to your car. I believe bluetooth is safer because you would be allowed to have hands free control over your phone. This essentially removes the problem of operating your phone while driving. You will only have to set up bluetooth once, so once your phone is paired there is no undoing it unless you please.

In conclusion, I don't think people should be allowed to use cell phones in their vehicle to any extent if it's unavoidable. People who do so not only are putting themselves at risk but other people's lives as well. Bluetooth is a great alternative to minimize the use of cell phones while operating vehicles. Most cars nowadays have this option. For people who don't have this option, i advise that you not only think about yourself, but as well as other people, when using your cell phone while driving.",1

These vehicles include trucks, sedans, vans, heavy machinery vehicles, bikes, etc. The use of a cellular device while operating a vehicle serves as a major distraction to the driver; even if the driver only looked at the phone just a second could call for a fatal result. Thousands of people die every year due to cell phone use while operating a vehicle, however fatalities, as such, could easily be avoided if drivers would wait until they're no longer driving to check their phones. Texting and driving can be as dangerous as driving intoxicated, driving under the influence, for you reaction time is weakened due to the distraction of your phone. A good reason to not text while driving would be that it takes only a few seconds to park your car, if looking at your phone is that important. With how today's cellphones are made to draw the user in, it is imperative that drivers make the smart decision to just wait to use their phones.

When texting while driving, you are more likely to end up in a wreck rather than going about your day. According to https://www. netsafeutah. org/teens/staysafe/distracted_driving. html , ""Drivers on the phone have worse reaction times than many drunk drivers."" this is important because when you look at your phone while driving is like the equivalent to driving with a blind fold on, and the time it takes the driver to look back at the road from looking at their phone is the same amount of time that it would take to take the ""blindfold"" off. According to https://www. nhtsa. gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving,

""Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed."" It only take five seconds of a distraction mistake to result in something that can catastrophically change your life forever, and not in a good way! In all consideration, as a driver, if there is a high need to be on the phone just pull the car over. Although it only takes five seconds of distraction to end in a crash, it takes just a few seconds to pull over safely.

Why risk the consequences of using a phone while driving to begin with? Although the results of using a phone while driving may very, the odds still are not in your favor! As the driver you not only risk your own life, but you also put other lives in your vicinity at risk. According to Jim Forsyth, a Reuters reporter, ""The typical reaction time without texting was between one and two seconds, but while texting it increased to three to four seconds, regardless of whether the driver was typing or reading a text."" (https://www. abc. net. au/science/articles/2011/10/06/3333955. htm). When it comes to driving reacting and timing is everything, but when a driver gets distracted it is almost inevitable for something bad to happen. When driving there is already so much happening on the road, so much that there's not much room for error, that those two seconds of reaction time are key to preventing a car crash. There are so many rules and laws to driving a motor vehicle, however the easiest, of all the rules and laws, is to not text while driving. In fact if a driver always follow this rule, they could be considered a superhero for all the lives they save by not putting others at risk because they did not text and drive.

Is texting and driving at the same time dangerous? One must not have a brain to think there are no risks to texting and driving. Sure, everyone has done it, so why not? Everytime a person texts and drives, they put themselves and others on the road in danger of ending in a car accident or worse death. Don't text and drive, because doing this you will save lives!",1
"The majority of people own and use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of this usage is done while said people are driving. While using a phone and driving is common, it can also be very dangerous. That is why people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. There are other reasons why phone usage should not be permitted while a person is driving.

One of the reasons a person should not be allowed to use their phone while driving is that the risk of getting into a car crash is raised. Those who text and drive are 23% more likely to be in a car crash than those who do not text and drive. In 2016, 3,450 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. Many states ban the use of phones behind the wheel for this reason. If people did not use their phone behind the wheel, the number of deaths and injuries would drop drastically.

The states that prohibit cell phone usage behind the wheel are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia. In Georgia, drivers are not allowed to touch any kind of electronic device with any part of their body. This law has been put into effect because of the more than 1,500 deaths from distracted driving in Georgia in 2016.

People should not be able to use their phones while driving. The use of phones behind the wheel puts many lives at risk. Many states have already banned the use of phones behind the wheel.

The rest of the United States should create new laws to prohibit the use of phones behind the wheel as well.",1
"Consequences for texting and driving.

In recent years there have been many studies conducted on how texting while driving is dangerous and the negative outcomes that usually happen. I believe nobody should operate a cell phone in any capacity while driving. One reason that you shouldn't use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you aren't considering other motorists. If you're too busy texting or talking you become distracted and you aren't concentrated on the road anymore. So many car accidents are caused by texting and driving. According to Georgia's driving statistics there are 3287 deaths each day from distracted driving. Texting and driving is illegal in the state of Georgia. On July 1st 2018 they made a law and it says ""all drivers operating a motor vehicle on any highway of this state is prohibited from holding or supporting..."" you know it's a pretty serious situation if the entire state of Georgia made a law about it.

Texting and driving also set bad examples for kids and other people. Often when you are operating a vehicle you have other passengers like young kids and teenagers. You don't want to text and drive in front of them because they may start to think that's the right thing to do. Kids tend to mock behaviors that they see others doing and if the mock the texting and driving habit those type of accidents will never stop. Due to texting and driving teens are 400 percent more likely to get into an accident. Teen drivers being distracted by cell phones is the number one killer in teenage deaths. With teens being so inexperienced with driving they need a completely focused and structured driving zone so that their full attention is on the road and nothing else.

Did you know that texting and driving slows your reaction time? Researchers at Texas A&M transportation conducted a ""how your reaction time is affected"" project. The normal reaction time without any distractions was one to two seconds, when you're texting and driving the reaction time number shoots up to four or five seconds. You may think ""oh whatever four to five"" seconds isn't enough time to cause any damage"" and in reality, if you're not paying attention for one second a lot can go wrong especially behind the wheel. Finally, one accident and your insurance goes sky high. Why would you want to pay money for something this is preventable? Texting and driving is pretty easy not to do. If you feel like you absolutely can't keep your hands off the phone there are tips to help with that. One thing you could do is put It inside of the glover department so that you can't reach it. One last tip that you could so is have a passenger (if you have one) to hold your phone so you can't get to it.

Now think about it...is texting and driving worth it? All the things that could go bad if you are distracted and driving should encourage you to drive distraction free. I think in order to prevent all these accidents among teens especially is to have cars that blocks out service so that phone access is completely impossible! Now that you've read this will you change, or will you continue to make the same careless decisions? Texting and driving accident percentages can go down if we all try to stop. People are dying and getting seriously injured because of that. Today let's make a promise that we will put the phones down and travel safe!",1
"Phones and Driving

Over the last few years there have been many records of death and/or Injury from being on your phone and driving. There are many laws in place to stop this act from happening, but just like with everything else, there's no way to fully stop it. Many people have different opinions on the subject. In this essay I will be explaining the two sides; good and the bad. How dangerous is it to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time?

Six thousand people die each year in the US due to texting and driving. Cell phone use should be prohibited why you operate any piece of machinery. Things malfunction and can go wrong with your full attention on them. Don't give any room for error. You aren't only putting yourself into danger but everyone else around you as well. Anything you do besides watching the road and focusing on your surroundings is putting your life at risk. Anything can happen in two seconds without your eyes on the road. Think about how many times you almost got into an accident due to someone else not paying attention, but you're fine because you were. A phone takes that away from you.

There's not a good side to texting and driving. They've made many alternatives to not having to touch your phone while driving but still being able to operate it. We all have a virtual human on our phones who tells us directions or calls who we want based on us saying things like, ""Hey Siri."" They make phone holders for your dash, but that's sill dangerous because you shouldn't take your eyes off the road anytime the vehicle is in motion. Everyone uses a cellphone while driving because they feel like they must be in a rush to get a text sent or etc. It isn't safe to be distracted by anything while driving let alone something so addicting already like a cellphone.

In conclusion, trying to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time is dangerous and life threatening. It takes one second to not be in an accident because you were too late. Just one second could change so many lives, and impact many more. You should stay focused on the road and arriving to your destination. That one missed phone call can be returned, and if not pull over somewhere safely and stay parked until you're done messing with your phone. Don't operate a phone and drive. The road requires your full attention.",1
"Today many people are on their phone & driving at the same time. Cell phone use while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries have been occurred from accidents caused by texting and driving. In my opinion, driving without phone use will decrease the percent of crashes around the world. Phone use is one of the reasons of car crashes occurring.

Answering a text takes at least 5 seconds of your attention away. That can be enough time for you to collide into another car or a car colliding into you. Even answering a call could take most of your distraction away from you seeing where you are driving. It would be safer to use the cell phone when you come to a complete stop or when you have reached your destination.

94% of teens that drive acknowledge the danger there can be by texting and driving, but 35% admit to doing it anyway. Teens are a big percent more likely than adults to get into a car crash or almost crashing into another car or anything that is in your path due to talking or texting on the cell phone. Also the amount of teen passengers doubles the risk of car crashes, because they are young & they like to use cell phones. They are even more of a distraction with all of the hype & noises.

263 teens (age 15 to 19) were killed as a result of distracted driving in 2016. The rate has increased throughout the years. If you can wait until you come into a complete stop or if you can wait until you reach your destination, please do so, because it will decrease the risk of crashes around the world.",1
"Should Drivers use Cell phones while driving?

What would we do without the latest technologies in our daily life? We use computers for work and in school, we use cell phones to access apps and do research. At home, we use microwaves to heat up food and landlines have been replaced by cell phones as the main phone of many people. In our daily lives we use cell phones to text, look up boarding passes, check flights and make phone calls. More and more, people are using technology, including cell phones, as an important part of their lives. As more and more people become dependent on the use of cell phones, some of the time they are being used may be in a car, while driving. Is the cell phone more helpful or hurtful when they are used by drivers in a car?

While a small minority of people do not have cell phones, the prevalence of cell phone ownership and use has increased. ""Cell phone usage is becoming a mounting issue in the United States with 91% of Americans (97% of people between 18-24) owning cell phones and using them for texting, calling and communicating for personal, work and school in daily life."" (""Cell Phone ownership""). Cell phones are so in trend with their convenience and popularity they seem to be increasing in numbers and not decreasing. ""Eighty-one percent of Americans own smart phones up from 35% in the 2011"" (""Mobile Fact Sheet""). It seems that more people are becoming dependent on them, despite the potential risks. For teens, texting has become more popular as making a phone call. Starting in the year 2001, State governments have started creating laws to limit cell phone usage by individuals driving in cars, as risks arise.

Despite the controversy there are benefits of cellphones especially for teenage students, who are now using new technologies during the school year. Cell phones are becoming more popular in school as a learning aid. ""In a recent poll 94% of students use their phones in class for learning"" (""Cell phone use""). The Majority of U.S. students are now relying on cell phones to get their school assignments and homework done. Since these teens have the cell phones in their possession, as they drive to school, they may be tempted to use them, both texting and calling, while they are behind the wheel. The benefits of this immediate communication with others and the convenience it creates, it may be outweighed by the risks and dangers of this usage.

In contrast to the benefits for cell phones, the dangers of distracted driving are real. Starting in the 2000's, States have started to restrict the use of cell phones while driving mainly due to the incidence of car accidents involving a driver using their cell phone. The fatalities do not just include the driver, but also the passengers and other victims. ""Twenty states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have hand-held cell phone use bans and thirty-eight states ban all cell phone use by novice and teen drivers"" (""Distracted Driving Laws""). ""Cell phone use while driving causing distracted driving has been linked to automobile accidents and fatalities"". (""Distracted Driving Laws""). The increase in accidents associated with cell phones is still controversial and there are arguments on both sides as far as the causes.

Some surprising emerging data shows a benefit of cell phones is their use in emergency situations. ""Patients are more likely to survive when emergency services are called from a cell phone rather than a landline"" (Weinlich). ""It is associated with improved mortality rates at the scene of medical events"" (""Mobile Phones proven""). Drivers may use their cell phones while driving to report an emergency. As more people continue to use cell phones more people may be able to helped and potentially saved in emergencies. Is the risk of distracted driving worth the potential benefit of helping someone in distress?

In addition to the risk associated with distracted driving there is another health risk associated with phone use. ""Cell phones give off a form of energy known as radiofrequency (RF) waves."" (""Cell Phone Safety""). And while this risk occurs whether the person is driving or not, it would be another reason for the driver to adhere to the handsfree laws. The concern has been a link that shows increasing risk of brain tumors of the head and neck while the driver holds the phone to the face (Creagan). ""The evidence is mixed though and there is limited evidence linking cell phone radiation to human cancer"" (""Electromagnetic Fields""). The mounting risks and seeming benefits for the driver are numerous and careful consideration must be used when considering using a cell phone while driving.

Overall phones have changed society for the better and for the worse. Since their introduction, the cell phone has significantly changed how people talk and has increased the convenience of personal communication. But the life-changing benefits of the cell phone come with many controversial risks. The negative effects of deaths from distracted driving along with other health concerns cannot be overlooked. Many distracted cell phone driver accidents occur with young teenage drivers actively using their cellphones while operating a motor vehicle. While these events may make the evening news, they will never bring back the special life of that driver, the passengers or others that may have been hurt or killed. More private and government agencies need to further expose the dangerous links of driver cell phone use to human health. There is a great need to further educate the public of these risks. Having these agencies along with Hollywood, TV and social media, where images and messaging catch teens attention, could positively educate drivers and shape what safe cellphone usage looks like. This positive action may ultimately save lives.

"Phone & Driving

It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.

Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.

Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.

Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.

To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.",1
". Phones & Driving

While using your phone anywhere sounds like a fun idea, it may not be the brightest idea... while driving. Technology is definitely a stepping-stone for all entertainment as a whole. Back then, in a not so distant past, people had to find things that entertained them, like objects around the room. There honestly was not much to do. Then came the commercial distribution of the home television. Eventually, almost every home in the country had at least one television. At that point, people could watch films and shows from the comfort of their home, instead of getting dirty or injured outside. Many years later came the technological advancement of telephones, known more modernly as smartphones. Smartphones were definitely a huge step in technology, because now you can take your entertainment with you. However... it may not have been the best thing.

Obviously, with this sort of convenience, people developed a way to multitask while using their smartphones. However, when something requires your utmost attention, like driving, that would be when you should probably put the phone down. However, using Bluetooth to answer calls is highly acceptable. The main problem at hand is looking at your phone while driving; it is a safety hazard. Now, there are pros, just as there are cons.

Texting while driving is now just as illegal as not wearing your seatbelt in Georgia. That does not mean you cannot use your phone for other things though. Cell phones have many different tools that can help you. Like a compass, or a clock, or especially a GPS. Obviously, you will not need a compass unless you are following a map in your car. The GPS, however, is a perfectly good example as to why using your phone while driving is a good thing. All you do is enter the address/coordinates and you just follow the route, while occasionally checking your screen to see if you are on track. Perfect for multitasking in the car.

Now onto the cons. There are excessively too many cons for you to even consider using your phone while operating a vehicle. The amount of distractions and casualties the problem creates should be more than enough to convince you to put your phone down while driving. Not only are you putting yourself at risk by doing this, but also anyone else who's near you on the road. So many people are injured and/or killed every year because of someone's poor decision to multitask, when their hand should be on the wheel.

To sum it all up, it can be both a blessing and a curse. You benefit from using phones and driving in some ways, but also risk harming others in the process. Texting while driving is not worth more than your well-being. If you are going to bring your phone, at least be smart about it. If not, you might end up like every ""texting while driving"" story; dead or severely injured. Just... think about it.",1
"Texting and driving

The use of phones and cars serve many purposes such as communicating with others, playing games, and using the many different internet based features.

We use cars as a means of travel, others to modify and race, and make them look cool. In every day jobs like firefighters and police use cars to patrol neighborhoods and to travel to the location they are called to. For delivery like packages and food we use cars and phones for most of the things we do in modern society. But get in some accidents or cause accidents with cars and we get hurt because of these accidents physically and financially but they can be avoided taking precautions like insurance and driving safe and keep your car maintenance high or good . According to https://www. insurancejournal. com/news/national/2018/08/24/499107. htm

The death toll for 2018 is 18,720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018. Texting and driving should not be aloud because it can kill people and its bad that it happens . People have lost their lives because of a text which is sad one moment your here next you're not you could be driving one day and text while driving with a blink of an eye you could be gone .

The laws and punishment the law should be to not be on your cell phone while driving or if you're are on it make sure it's on speaker phone or have somebody text on your phone to whoever. The punishment should be a fine or community service but no serious punishment because it was an accident . But if it was on purpose then should have jail time why because it was done intentionally and they knew exactly what they were doing . It's a accident most of the time but the point is that it happens which we can't prevent car accidents but we can decrease them.

And for coverage for your car like insurance cost sometimes a lot of money it really depends on the insurance company and the benefits from that company . but it's worth it and don't text and drive it may cost you a lot of money or your life it's important to keep your eyes on the road at all times and to pay attention from crashing or getting crashed into .We have highway patrol and police with speeding guns to prevent crashes people cause by speeding or not paying attention . We also have cameras to catch these things that cause accidents and they work most of the time but doesn't reduce accidents . And checkpoints for people who are under the influence and who are intoxicated and who drunk driving . These are some fact to provide evidence that texting and driving is dangerous and has killed people and some things that prevent it .",1
"Can you Deal with taking a life and living in regret for the rest of your life?

Well think about this is driving and texting really needed....is that message you sending so important that you could spend the rest of your life behind bars?

Texting and driving is illegal in almost every state you can think of because of so many incidents were some has been hurt or critically injured because your hand was on your phone and not on the wheel. Texting is a everyday thing for us we have to tweet and reply to comments but at what cost.

For the rest of your life you will have to deal with that pain and constant flash backs.

I personally don't believe that people should be able to use there phone while operating a motor vehicle . The average percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were they were distracted by their cell phones is 21% . Even though that's not a high percent it's alot of hurt for the parents victim and the driver of that vehicle cause not only are you putting your sure in danger you putting that victim at risk of loosing there life to.

Always check the facts and let someone know they could end their life by just one stupid mistake . You have the choice to do right after reading this essay to live your life to the fullest of have it cut short by a car hitting you or you hitting someone or being sentenced to life or even worse death .

"Phones and Driving

Having a cellphone when driving is dangerous. Dangerous for you and the people around you. Most people lives are taken each and every day by a simple act called ""Careless Driving"". The act of texting and has come across from this new generation.

Statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone and at least 341000 involved text messaging.

Texting while driving is worse than talking while driving. Talking while driving isn't as bad because your focused on the road but at the same time, you're trying to listen to someone else's conversation, and you try to get over and you think your focused and you're not then boom a car crash. Texting while driving as to be the worst thing ever and causes more effects and injuries. Texting while driving you have look down at your phone instead of it being in front of you the boom when you rise back up to see the road, you're on the other side of or about to hit a car.

Statistics show that 37,461 lives were lost on U.S roads in 2016 an increase of 5.6% from 2015 until 2017. Also, in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers. So, it seems that texting while driving is way dangerous then talking while driving its many proving facts you get kilt faster while texting and driving.

They have cars today that can stop people from having cellphones in their hand. Bluetooth is more optional and more used in high classed cars for more protection, but still can cause accidents. There our laws today that can send you to jail containing the driving and texting which is if you don't have a car that has Bluetooth or a stand for your phone then you're not able to use it and your will get a ticket.

To conclude this please don't text and drive if it's not meant to do. You can save a lot of lives mostly yours. More lives are saved every day because its less wreck less drivers and more safety.",1
"The use of cellphones today has increased dramatically over time almost everyone owns a cellular device and has become addicted to being on it. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing a raise to people's insurance, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation. Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year caused by from by texting. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving while using a cell phone while drunk and driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accidents and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.

Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.",1
"Driving while on your cellphone is a safety hazard. You should never be on your cell phone while driving because it is dangerous. Many people die every day due to being on their cell phones while driving. Texting and driving is a big distraction that causes many deaths. If you are operating a vehicle, your attention should always be on the road. Although many teens are getting blamed for texting and driving, many adults do it too. Texting and driving has caused many deaths over the last couple of years in the U.S. Most of today's car crashes are due to texting and driving.

It's very important to not text and drive. To begin, it's very dangerous and can cause a lot of problems, including accidents. However, texting and driving is not the only thing that causes accidents. If you're talking on the phone while driving, that can be a big problem as well. When talking on the phone, you can get distracted easily. Driver's need to focus on driving and not be distracted by phones or any other electronic devices.

Another reason you should not operate a phone while driving is because you may harm yourself or others. Small children could be in the car and drivers should be aware of such precious cargo. Children are most vulnerable when it comes to car crashes. That's why it's very important to be mindful about texting and driving. Young kids die every day because of careless drivers.

In closure, the main reason why you shouldn't text and drive is because other people's lives are at stake. Many people don't understand how dangerous using an electronic device while operating a vehicle can be. Texting and driving can be harmful and fatal. If more people learn how to wait until they get to their destination, then more lives would be saved. Help prevent texting and driving by focusing on the road. The lives of others aren't worth losing over a text.",1
"Phones have become the common distraction as of today. Everywhere you turn, there are phones in every hand either talking or texting even as people are driving. No one should be allowed to drive and be on their phone at the same time. People should be focusing on the road and not their phone because it's dangerous for other drivers on the road and themselves. There are many accidents that happen just because someone isn't paying attention to the road.

Phones shouldn't be allowed on the road as someone is driving because it can be dangerous for people that walk and can cause uncertain deaths.

Many people walk to their destinations to meet friends or to even go to work if it's close. They should be able to cross the road without having to worry about a car plowing them down. If someone is driving and they're focusing on their phone, they wouldn't be able to see the person walking across the street. A phone shouldn't have that much of a hold over you. A lot of deaths happen just from people not diverting all of their attention to the road. They're too busy typing on their phones, trying to send a message that could have waited until they reached where they were going. Another life gone down the drain all because a driver paid more attention to their phone than the road.

Drivers are distracted while they're on the phone meaning they aren't paying any mind to the cars behind or in front of them. Accidents can happen anywhere at any time of the day. There are so many car crashes that happen on the highways and most of the time, it is because the driver was on their phone. People can get injured or worse, they can die from the sudden impact of the crash. Therefore, drivers should keep their eyes and mind on the road to prevent the death of injury of someone else.

Phones are the biggest distraction to drivers as of today and they should be banned from use when driving. People believe that there are more drunk driving deaths than there are driving and texting deaths. Eventually, a law will have to be made to prevent driving while on you are on your phone. In other words, no one should use their phones while they're driving because of the horrible damage it could do to someone else.",1
"A large majority of the population has a smart phone or some other devise like it. A lot of these people think they cannot live without their phone being on their person. This causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. They do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. They also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. All these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone.

In America 28% of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. This is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. This is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. Motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non-distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied.

In 2019 most cars on the road have a hands-free devise built in to the car. This helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. A lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash.

A lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. You will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. I am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. People need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones.

In conclusion I believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. Using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. There are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands-free systems. And finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone. There is just too much at risk to be driving distracted.",1
"Required Essay: Phones & Driving

As the years progress technology has been a part of our lives and we cannot ""function"" without it. We have adapted to technology so much we use it in our everyday. But technology does not always make a positive impact on our lives. We just need to know how to use it.

We use our phones so much it's beginning to be too much. We use it when we walk, eat, etc. But most dangerously when we are driving. Our phones cause a big distraction that we do not pay attention to anything we do. Using our phones while we drive can lead to small, big, or even fatal accidents. Not just on the driver, but also anyone who is nearby. According to Edgar Snyder, approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phones while behind the wheel. In fact, using our phones and driving is the leading cause of death for teenagers today. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur every year because of accidents caused by using our phones and driving.

After numerous accidents and injuries, most teenagers are pledging not to text and drive. The percentage of injuries involving the subject has dropped and is still dropping.

"Phone While Driving

Using your cell phone while driving has become a bigger issue now due to the increased popularity of use in technology. People have begun to use cellphones more than the traditional GPS so they use it as an excuse to using your cell phone while driving. It is even harder to avoid using your cellphone while driving unless you put your phone on do not disturb while you're driving but even doing that there is very little that you can do to avoid people calling and distracting drivers from the road. Using your phone while driving also leads to many car accidents because people just aren't paying attention to the road. Driving and using phones can cause death , is hindering children's lives,and how we can prevent death in our society,

The death rate has gone up because ""263 teens (ages 15 to 19) were killed as a result of distracted driving in 2016"" at least half of teen deaths in motor vehicles among young people are related to using cell phones while driving .This is becoming a very serious matter and may be affecting someone close to you.

The national safety council of the united states of america said that""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". Car accidents can lead to deaths and also brain cell lossage these things can and will affect the futures of people who are involved in them. A way to lower these numbers would be by closely monitoring your own and the people who are around you cell phone usage while driving and always speak up when you see people doing it.

cell phone use while driving has gotten out of hand because of the increased popularity of use in technology. It has become a bigger issue because people who do it believe driving and using their phone is ok and no one will catch them, and do not take it as a serious issue. That is why it has gotten out of control because people think of it as a law that can be broken and it is nowhere near that.

If Driving and using phones was to be taken more serious less crashes would happen.

Without people speaking up driving and using cellphones will only continue to happen if we don't apply these better ways to prevent it. cell phone use while driving is a very serious issue and should be taught to more of our youth so that accidents can be lowered and we can live in peace. because Driving and using phones is not ok, and drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.",1
"Distractive driving

Two seconds is all it takes to risk the lives of the driver and people on the road. For the driver to take their eyes and brain off the task of driving is highly dangerous. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they are putting their safety and others endangered and risk rising insurance prices.

Multitasking and using a mobile phone while behind the wheel is distracting to the driver, which can be life-threatening. Distractive driving effects all drivers equally whether the driver is talking on the phone, texting, on social media, or taking photos. For example, Emily wrote, ""Unfortunately, more and more people are making the dangerous decision to text and drive, which causes 1.6 million crashes and almost 400,000 injuries per year, according to The National Safety Council-that's one out of every four car accidents!""(Delbridge) In other words, studies found that operating a mobile phone while driving slows the reaction time of the driver, and restricts a driver's perception skills; which increases the likelihoods of being involved in a collision. Distractive driving is equivalent to drunk driving because the behavior causes negative consequences that are life threatening. Especially for inexperience drivers and those who lack skill. To add on, the ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"" states, ""In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States."" (Distracted Driving Research)

All driver should know that if they cause an accident because of risky behavior, their car insurance rate will certainly increase. It is important to know because the bad behavior of distractive driving can have an impact on other drivers too. For instance, Emily's article states, ""Because of this, car accident rates have risen over 14 percent since 2014. Not only does this make driving more dangerous for everyone, but it also contributes to increased car insurance premiums for everyone."" (Delbridge) The car insurance premiums are established by many different components, including the drivers' neighborhood, age, distance of commute, driving history, and the behavior of other drivers. The last category is why texting and driving effects everyone. Those who tend to use their cellphone while driving is the reason that the annual U.S. traffic fatalities are rise with insurance claims.

Drivers should not use their mobile phone in any way while operating any motorize vehicle. If there is any need to use the cellphone for emergencies, the GPS, or music, Please, pullover or do it before you start to proceed driving.

In conclusion drivers need to drive and only drive because whatever it is that is distracting is not worth people's lives.

In this day and age you could not go anywhere without seeing a cell phone. It is obvious that they are a very important part of our society today. However a big problem and debate that everyone has is whether or not they should be aloud for use while driving. They can take your focus off of the task at hand which could be dangerous. However I believe that they should be allowed for use while driving.

In the car, a cell phone can be very useful. One big thing it is used for is maps. You can use your cell phone to look up your destination. Without the use of your maps you could get lost around town. Or stuck somewhere that you do not want to be. This could see to be dangerous so your cell phone could help you.

Another reason I personally believe they should be used is for music. I do not believe I could find many people to agree with me on this one if I am being honest. However, the music is very important to some people and it can help concentration while driving. It can keep you awake if you are tired. I think it is safe, as long as you just shuffle a playlist and do not stay looking at your phone to change songs.

Cell phones all around can be very helpful when it comes to driving. They can help your focus with music so you're not falling asleep behind the wheel. They can also help you not get lost in the middle of nowhere. So as long as you are safe and aware I think cell phones can be beneficial to driving.",1

People driving while looking at their phones has become an epidemic and is a big cause of a lot of accident. Primarily involving teens who are so distracted by their phones that they are not paying any attention to the road. With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.

If you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger.

"Being on your phone while driving is very debatable. Some people say it helps time wise and work rate and is just overall more convenient.

Honestly though, I believe that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it has more cons than pros.

Being on the phone while driving has many reasons. Maybe you have to communicate to someone because its urgent and you don't have the time to wait till you're done driving. Sometimes you are talking to someone over the phone or through text because you find it more convenient and private in your own car. Or maybe you just feel like scrolling through social media because you're bored. It might save time if your running late to places and it might be easy for people. They might think the accidents could never happen to them because they are too good of drivers.

The truth is that If you think texting in an emergency situation is ok but it will end up causing another problem on top of what's going on if you get into an accident just because you needed to make the call or send the message for an emergency.

about 9 people are killed every day and over 1,000 injured because of distracted drivers on their phones. Texting while driving is the leading cause of teen deaths in these past years. ""DMV.org"" can prove all of my statements and statistics to be true.

Texting while driving also has legal repercussions, in 47 states out of the 50 it is illegal to text and drive. you can get fined for about $125 for just your first offence. If you don't think paying that much for one ticket is far well also note that because of that you will have an increase in insurance payments. You can also get your license suspended and won't be able to even drive till they give it back. In some cases, you can even end up in prison for it. Is sending a meme worth possible jail time? It is best to just break the bad habit. It will make you drive better because no distractions and you don't have to worry about the cops pulling you over or anything like that. It will leave you more relaxed at the end of the day.

Being on your phone while driving is done all the time and can't be completely stopped but it should honestly be stopped all together.

In the day of age, 25% of car crashes involve driving while using phones. That is a huge number and already 1 reason why you shouldn't drive while using a phone. I will give you some reasons why you shouldn't drive with phones.

Fatal injury or death is one reason. You are in a big metal vehicle in which case, can crash. When crashed, multiple things could happen to you. Burning, crushed, stabbed is few of the things that can injure, or kill you. Your not affecting youself, but affecting people who probably got hit while you crashed. You might have or had killed them.

Another is jail time or bieng sued. If you had hit a person, another car, or property damage, you can get arrested for that. The fine cost could go up to 500,000$ and a jail time for a minimum of 2 years.

Lastly, is hurting your family and friends. Say you're a father and your wife calls you. You have your best friend in the next seat and your kid in the back. Out of nowhere, a truck comes and you t-bone into the truck. Your kid has a brokin rib and your best friend is dead. Do you really want that to happen?

Morale of this essay is, never go on your phone when you drive. Don't answer texts, don't answer the phone, and don't look up things on the internet.",1

People should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous and illegal to text while driving. Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use cell phones while driving. People who use cell phones while driving are putting themselves and other people in danger; therefore, they are likely to get hurt. Drivers that are distracted by cellphones are likely to not pay attention to the road or be aware what is happening on the road. Three reasons people should not use their phones while driving is that they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions. People can easily get distracted by being on the phone with someone while driving. Some distractions are interruptions and entertainment by engaging in talking to someone outside your car and not paying attention to the other people or vehicles around you. Drivers should always pay attention to the road, because it is uncertain what might happen particularly, if the driver is not being careful while driving. In this case, they are more likely to have a crash.

Another reason people should not use their phones while driving, is because accidents happen when drivers do not focus on their surrounding. Operating a phone while driving is equal to; talking to people in your vehicle, or tampering with the radio instead of paying attention to the road, in regards to driving hazards. Some drivers that use cell phones while driving, cause accidents; therefore, they end up have to face serious consequences.

Finally, drivers should not use phones while driving because it can cause injuries. People can suffer pain and be all bruised up, because of the irresponsible driver not paying attention to the road. In addition, some injuries sustained as a result of cellphone use while driving, results in death. Some injuries due to the use of cellphones while driving can cause victims to have internal bleeding, skull fractures, or head, brain, neck, back injuries, and so on. In order to prevent injuries, the driver of the car should turn their phone off at all times while driving. When the driver gets to their destination, then they can resume using their phones. People should only use their phone before or after driving.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries. Cellphones use while driving can greatly increase the risk of having an accident. Drivers that drive while not paying attention, are putting others' lives at risk and that is selfish. While driving, people should look out for signs and other things like animals and people. If someone calls the driver, then the driver can ask the person beside them to answer it.

Eliminating cellphones is the best way to save people lives.",1
"When it comes to driving on the road, the use of a phone is the number one leading cause to car accidents. While reading and texting is prohibited when driving, phones tend to be a reliable resource which helps improve our daily life.

Phones help us in many ways when it comes to driving. They help navigate us in unknown areas, and it is a great form of contact in case of emergencies. Although it tends to be distracting, technology has advanced that we can have our eyes on the road while communicating with others.

Over the years technology has evolved rapidly so that it could make life easier for us, such as bluetooth. Bluetooth is a setting on a smart device like a phone, where you can connect wirelessly with another piece of hardware, like headphones. So, if someone tries to call you while driving, all you have to do is press the button on your headphones, and you will have the ability to call, or hang up the phone.

Phones can be a great use of navigation. With sources like Google maps, it has replaced all normal paper maps for when it's time to enter a new area. Not only were the original maps were a disturbance to drivers, but your phone can literally tell you how, when, and where to take you. Whether it is warning you about construction, or when to turn left or right, your phone is there to help for this uncanny situation.

Communication is very important in this day in age. So if you were scheduled for an appointment but you are late due to traffic or for an emergency situation, you can use your phone during that situation and explain why you need to reschedule. Not only that, but if you arrive at a destination, but having trouble finding a person you need to pick up, you can just give them a call, and tell them to start heading outside.

Texting while driving is a really problematic situation when it comes to acquiring a vehicle. It will lead you to bad injuries, or even death. But if a driver uses these ideas and guideline while driving, phones would not be a controversial topic that it is now. Drive smarter, and have good safety when it comes to driving.",1
"Driving and using cell phones is and always will be dangerous to me. I think that using cellphones while driving is the main way people get into car wrecks today. Drivers Shouldnt use cellphones while driving. Using cellphones while driving is very dangerous and is taking the lives of many innocent people also. Driving while using phones is becoming very common, the reason why states are coming up with new laws. Drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving because it's a big distraction and is a big reason why people get into car accidents everyday.

Using cellphones while driving is a big distraction for a lot of different reasons. One reason why people shouldn't use their phone is because they lose focus of where they are going. I've been in a car before with somebody that was on their phone and we almost went off the road. Another reason is because you're not only putting your life in danger but everybody else that's driving around you. People have told me about accidents they have been in and they got hit by somebody that wasn't paying attention. It's easier to drive when you're off your phone. You don't have to worry about who texted or call you just focusing on the road. As long as people keep using their phones while driving accidents are going to keep increasing. A crash happens within an average of three seconds after a driver is distracted. We don't need to use our phones while driving. It's the quickest distraction while driving and it only takes 3 seconds to get distracted by a text or call and you get seriously injured.

People should not be able to use cellphones while driving because they use it for the wrong reasons while driving. Some people might say they need to use their phone because they need their GPS or if they get into an accident they need to make a call, But there are GPS's that have voices that speak the directions out loud. For emergencies people can easily pull over and make that call. Some also might say music but there are radios in the car. Answering a phone call while driving is also very dangerous. If the call that you answered to is very argumentative your anger could show in your driving. Using your phone while driving is almost worse than drinking and driving and is a proven fact. Using your phone while driving is second on the list for deaths while driving. With all this being said, Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones because it's a distraction and does not lead to anything good.

Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle?",1
"Phones and Driving

I think drivers should not be able to use their cellphone in any capacity while operating vehicle, for 2 reasons, one example when you're driving and using a cell phone while operating a vehicle you're not 100% paying attention on the road and that's already bringing danger to other drivers driving on that road when your texting you can forget that roads are shared with everyone. that can cause accidents and if an accident occurs because you was using your phone and not paying attention fully on the road that can get you in legal trouble and you can also pay a big fine for that accident, also your insurance bill is going to go up. Another example if you have passengers with you they can get harmed because of your mistake using a cellphone in a capacity while operating a vehicle. The driver will also experience a physical distraction by having to release the steering wheel to attend to the cell phone text messaging is really considered the most dangerous effect. In studies from scholarly authors, nowadays they have bluetooth text to prevent more accidents and its actually helping somehow. To many people dying to car accidents and have died due to an accident and sum of them were killed because some idiot decided to text and drive and risked others their lives, and that's not fair to the people.

So this is why I think People should not be driving a vehicle while operating a cellphone.",1
"Phones and Driving

I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating vehicle. Its puts innocent lives at risk. It's more likely to cause a wreck. And also is illegal in many states. Cellphones should be put up so everyone can safe while driving.

Being on your cellphone while driving vehicles can put innocent lives at risk. You make decisions to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives around you. For instance, in the passage ""Reason to Stop Texting and Driving"", it says ""Actions of ""answering a text"" or just looking at a text, means that you will selfishly put other people's lives in danger"". The innocent people such as young children, friends, and etc. did nothing wrong to cause you to risk their live due to your poor decision. Its one thing to put your own like in danger, but unfair to risk lives of others.

Texting while driving can most likely cause a big wreck. In the studies of drvivngtest. org, it shows that those who text and drive are 23% more likely to be involved in a car accident. Wrecking your vehicle will cause you to pay car insurance, also pay for the car to get fixed. You basically just risking life and others around you, which will cause you to pay even more insurances. You will have to [pay the price for the mistake of texting and driving.

And also, texting while driving is illegal in many states. In passage ""Reasons to Stop Texting Fines and Driving"" it says ""punishments for texting and driving range depends on what states you live in"". For some states, the fines is $20, however, it can be up to $500. If action of texting and driving get anyone injured, you can end in jail. This is the icing on the cake as to why you shouldn't text and drive.

When driving a vehicle please put your phone AWAY! If you don't want to have to pay for anything or get hurt, it's best to follow rules. We all have to stay safe.",1
"Drivers shouldn't be able to text and drive. If you look at recent studies, you'll see that vehicular accidents have gone down in the last couple of years due to no strict ""no texting while driving"" laws. The reason for this is because once you get rid of the distracting handheld screen, your proficiency increases. Drivers that's always distracted by a mobile device could cause a road rage or even a big accident to the public. It isn't caring is could be highly dangerous for you and for the people around you, including the environment. This could also increase every chance of you getting pulled over by the cops if you're unlucky.

A driver's attention should solely be on the road. Their focus is already easily split by passengers, and even so with the recreational use of cellular devices. To drive, is to invite danger and risk into your life tenfold. Apparatuses like phone stands on bluetooth functionality are both proper substitutes that reduce the risk and danger of using your cell phone while driving. All in all, unless the proper measures are taken, cellular devices shouldnt be used while driving.

To say that there is a time devices should be used, maybe should be only for gps for navigation. Other than that Devices in a hand of a driver should be prohibited and forced to drive safely to their desired destination harm free. Getting caught being on a device while driving can be very treacherous, being pulled over can result in multiple tickets and will lower your credit score and that isn't so good. That goes to say driving comes with many responsibilities.

That one second where you think it is safe to pull out your phone , can be that one second later you're in the hospital. Driving can lead to serious injuries driver of any should not take focus off the road to take part in activity that doesn't have to do with what's in front of them. Studies shows 1,2 million people die every year in car crashes between the ages 15-44. So while driving take your mind of the device and start driving right, always remember that a phone will go nowhere but a life will.

Reasoning on no devices while driving is part of the law, and should be obeyed by any means.

Obviously taking a call while driving or answering a text could be severe for you and either for others that's on the road. The awareness of you not focusing on the road can lead to jail time as well, texting and driving is illegal and if your record is bad you may go to jail for such a little thing that can cause a big problem. People may cherish their phones like their life may depend on it but not focusing can put someone else's life in grave danger/",1
"Do you think cellphones should be used while driving? Using your phone is the top ten ways of accidents. I don't think you should use your cell phone while driving because it is very dangerous to you and other cars. You can look down for 10-15 seconds then look ""BOOM"" it's a crash. That should be one of the least ways you want to die even though it's not always your fault.

Using a cell phone is a big distraction, not only to you but to others to. Everyone has to pay attention to the road just like you will have to. It can cause you to swerve; stop on brakes to hard, not pay attention to your surroundings, and last but you least it will cause a wreck. You can put others in dangers from your use to the road.

Having 4 mirrors in total is the reason for a car, without mirrors you will be driving and have nothing to look forward to and also backwards. Looking forward is the way to go because if you keep looking at what's beside you and behind you will cause a lot of commotion in traffic. If that can cause commotion imagine what looking down at your cell phone can do and what trouble it can put you in.

Explaining all this to the police is a big mess when the situation can be resolved by just focusing on the road and what's in front of you. More importantly is your life and you staying alive. If you need your GPS to get somewhere its best you buy a phone holder to hold the phone up on your window or just buy a GPS from a nearby store.

In conclusion, stay off your phone! It's a trend now not only to you but to the whole world. It's impossible to do 2 things at one time while you control a steering wheel. You can take innocent lives fin a matter of seconds for a message or phone call that could have waited. If texting or being on the phone is more important just pull over.",1
"Should people who are driving be able to use cell phones while they drive? I strongly disagree, as there are new teens driving everyday. Teens tend to use their phones a lot and they probably haven't been driving as much as some adults. Regardless of how long you have been driving i personally think you should not be texting and driving, or doing anything with your phone. Teens are probably the people who cause most of the crashes due to them texting and driving or not focusing on the road.

Most teens take driving as if they were in a video game. I believe they use this thought process because in some video games you tend to do reckless driving and i think some teens take that idea. I personally think that ever since smart phones came out the car crash rates have gone up extremely. This is due to the egear of wanting to use your cellular device. I don't think we can stop texting and driving because most people do it and then act innocent when they see a police car near them. I know this from experience.

I disagree with this because people's lives are in danger with just a swipe or just writing a 3 letter text. You keep your eyes off the road which means anything can happen in the slightest second. I think there should be some type of app that you have to use in order to turn your car on, which then locks your phone until the car is off or you have reached your destination. Texting and driving is a serious cause and teens & adults should take this more seriously so they can risk not getting into an accident.",1
"Cell Phones and Driving

Should you be permitted to drive a vehicle while using a device? In this case you shouldn't because it comes with many risks while you're on the road. You put yourself in danger while putting other drivers in danger as well. You risk your life with others on the line too!!!!

To begin with it's a big distraction on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers. You tend to check your phone so much which can cause you to crash with someone else. But also take the focus of your surroundings while driving. It takes your focus away from safe driving. One single text can make a blink of an eye change your life of someone else's life. Also when you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. It also takes your hands off the steering wheel to answer one single text.

Another reason that driving while using a device should be allowed is because it is illegal. You get pulled over and get a ticket. But also if caught many times can cause those digits tickets to go up which means big money tickets. It can also rise in auto insurance rates. It can lead up to prison time as well .Is it worth risking your freedom?

More so, is it worth the emotional damage a car accident causes to everyone involved?

Also it leads to getting your license suspended. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another one of the most serious driving offenses which is a DUI.

A third reason that using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed is because it can have huge risks. Sending or replying to a text requires that you remove at least one hand from the steering wheel so that you can grip your phone and thumb in a reply. So not only are you multitasking and not focusing your eyes from the road, but you're also trying to deftly use your phone with one hand while at the same time steer your vehicle. So not only do you risk crashing with other vehicles but also losing the steering wheel which is the control of driving the vehicle.

Being able to use a device while operating a vehicle shouldn't be allowed. It brings too many risks and changes to the environment of driving. There would be a lot of accidents on the highway due to having access to a device while driving. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children. It is every driver's responsibility to always be careful and attentive, ensuring everyone can safely get from Point A to Point B. Which is why driving with a device on your hand shouldn't be allowed.",1
"Driving is fun of course, making plans with your friends, going out, having fun but it can also impact your life because this world isn't perfect and there could be worst times in your life or better days. It could be times were you crash or get stopped.

So in my honest opinion humans shouldn't be using cells phones when they are driving because it could cause a big accident and can even risk taking their own life. Many people drive and text and their so entertain with their phone that they don't keep up with the road and sometimes lose control of the wheel.

Not only do people use their phone but they wonder off to space or some are too busy looking at cars or doing their makeup. So it is wrong to use your phone while you in the car driving it can do major stuff you can even get stopped by the police by texting and driving. People should be more careful on driving. You might not sometimes take your own life but you can take other people life by doing a major crash. So people who are so addict with their phones shouldn't be driving for many reasons. And should let someone else drive.

Like phones can ruined so much in society and can cause a lot of damage. So I am very against on using phones while driving. It's like most of the drivers I seen are on their phone and don't see when a green light or red is on or when there's stop texting and paying attention to the road or you just don't care signs or any other kind of signs. So it's either you save your life by not driving and keep having your eyes off the road and do a major impact and crash.

In conclusion, overall driving and texting is bad. So yes, in my opinion I think you should save your calls and messages for later and pay attention to the road so you can get safely to your destination and be glad nothing happened on the road because anything can happen in a heartbeat.",1
"Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Cell phones are a big part of our society today. We can perform any task on a cell phone. 91 percent of American adults own some type of cell device. It is a proven fact that a large number of fatalities and injury in vehicle crashes are due to using the cell phone while driving. The state of Georgia passed a handsfree act that took effect on July 1, 2018. Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any other body part while driving. Texting while driving is bad and dangerous for you and other drivers. If you take your eyes off the road for a split second you are putting your life and others live's in danger. Even if you look down at the time on your phone you are putting yourself into harm's way. ""Texting while driving you are four times more likely to get into an accident rather than just driving without texting"".

(Poole 1).

Using your cell phone while driving will increase the risk of you getting into an accident.

At least one out of every twenty drivers will use a phone while driving a vehicle. Even the use of hand's free phones is not any better. The use of a blue tooth is dangerous in my opinion.

""Texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk."" (Edwards 1) If you even use a simple text it can take your eyes off the road for a few seconds. ""Of all cell phone related tasks texting is by far the most dangerous activity."" (Edwards 1) Teens who text while they drive spend at least ten percent of their driving time outside of the lane they are in.

You should not use cell phones or any device while driving. The proof is in the pudding as they say. I gave you all of the facts, so it is your choice to choose the right one. Do Not text while you drive.

"Phones and Driving

Today, the majority of people own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many debate on whether people should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over time, the usage of cell phones has increased drastically. Fatal accidents cause an unwanted feeling in the end. Using your cell phone while operating a vehicle puts other drivers in harm's way. This can be prevented with the simple creation of car gadgets or simply putting your phone on do not disturb or just shut it off.

In my opinion, phone usage in any capacity of moving vehicles should be prohibited. A one minute text or even just being on your phone is not worth your life or anyone else's. According to ""Bran Law Firm"", Almost 200,000 people die from fatal injuries every year. This is equivalent to about one person every three minutes. National averages report about 37,000 crash-related fatalities every year. This breaks down to about 101 deaths per day in the United States. When you are driving a vehicle your main goal is to focus on the roads, and everything going on around you.

Many accidents in America are caused by teens and bad drivers. Amongst accidents, an average of nine teens ages 16-19 are killed every day from motor vehicle injuries. 2,739 drivers ages 15-20 are killed and an additional 228,000 are injured in crashes. A total of 4,054 teens between the ages of 13-19 die in car accidents. 81% of teens killed in car accidents are passengers. There are many ways to prevent Teen accidents or accidents in general. Enrolling in driving school, it creates great practice from someone who has amazing driving skills. Don't ever drive drowsy, being sleepy can impair their judgment, vision, hand-eye coordination and reaction times as much as alcohol and drugs. A study by AAA and the National Sleep Foundation found that individuals (regardless of age) who've slept two hours or less within 24 hours shouldn't be driving at all, and four or five hours of sleep in 24 hours will still leave drivers ""substantially impaired.""

Today there are many gadgets that can help the decrease in accidents. On Instamotor it discusses 5 best gadgets to comply with hand-free driving. One gadget is ""Scosche Magic Mount"". These very inexpensive mounts are available in a variety of attachment methods, from adhesive dash mounts to windshield suction cups, to adjustable arm mounts, and more. The best part of the Magic Mount is that it uses strong magnets to securely hold any phone to its surface. We've road-tested these mounts ourselves over thousands of miles and find them to be plenty secure even over rough roads. Despite the firm grip, the Magic Mount is typically small and unobtrusive, so it won't look like a small robot is trying to steal your car when it's not in use.

Another useful gadget is called the ""Motorola Roadster Pro In-Car Speakerphone"". If you really don't like the idea of having to pull your phone out of your pocket or purse every time you get into the car to secure it to your dash or windshield, however, and you don't have Bluetooth hands-free calling integrated into your car's audio system, there is another class of gadgets that will serve you well: the two-way Bluetooth in-car speakerphone. These devices typically clip to your sun visor, though some mount to other locations, and act as a traditional office speakerphone, except that they're linked to your cell by Bluetooth, and they're in your car. This means even cars without integrated Bluetooth can have the comfort and convenience of hands-free calling without ever touching your phone at all.

To conclude, always pay attention to the road and do not use your cell phone. If you do so try having something that can easily attach to the glass window especially if its a phone call, try putting your phone on do not disturb next time you enter your car, and always remember that a text that can be sent in seconds it not worth death. How do you think you would be able to drive a car, focus on the roads, and still be able to use your phone",1
"PHONES & DRIVING

Texting while driving is one of the worrying trends in the society, both teenagers and adults have developed a habit of using cell phones while driving. Texting while driving causes distraction and increases their chance of getting involved in car accidents. Such concerns have been raised by various government authorities, in trying to prevent such occurrence new laws have been enacted making cell phones use in cars illegal. However, not many people follow these laws, most people text and drive, assuming they can pay attention to other cars. Texting while driving is dangerous for many reasons.

Cell phone use while driving is the major cause of fatal accident, leaving to deaths. Despite these consequences, people are still fixated on their phones that are dangerous to not only the driver but also to other road users. According to the recent road statistics, more than 22 percent of fatal road accidents are caused by teenagers using their cellphones while driving. Also the distraction of the roads is cause by teenagers who have confidence that they can text or be on the phone while driving. Over more than 5,000 people have died last year due to texting; these accidents are mostly caused by young adults of the age 21 and under.

Furthermore, currently there are only 35 states the US have completely banned texting for all its road users, but this isn't enough to stop the problem. Laws that were banning texting while driving will save many peoples' lives. With it being that more than 5,000 people died in the last year caused by distracted drivers. It's very important that the government should take stricter action to try to decrease the deaths caused by theses distracted drivers. It is necessary for the government to enact unifying laws and stricter punishments for those who text while driving.

On the other hand, these news laws need to ban texting while driving for everyone not just for young adults, because it has similar effects on everyone who does it. There should be objection to laws for texting while driving. I feel as if each states needs to have similar laws against texting while driving. For example. Massachusetts laws on texting should be a role model for all of the other states. Massachusetts has the strictest laws on road safety. Punishment for those found texting while driving should be so stiffened to push people to dig deeper into their pockets to pay more. The fine alone is enough; stricter regulations should include license suspension to make people keep off their phones while driving.

In a nutshell, despite the laws forbidding texting while driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text & drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people that could have been a very per cautious and they lose lives every day because of careless drivers. Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things on the road today due to all of this technology, and they will not stop making this technology just because people are getting in accidents stop the text stop the wrecks. Take the pledge to stop texting and driving.",1
"Do you think that drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their phone in the car? I think that drivers should not use their phone in the car. A lot of people get into accidents and some leads to death just because your texting or doing other things on your phone. We all know that cellphones can be really distracting but putting them away can save a lot of lives. Not having your phone out is the same as not having accidents.

One reason why you should not have cell phones is because a lot things can happen which is bad. For example You can be arguing with somebody on the phone and not see that the light turned red and keep going and a truck come and hit you. Arguing while texting can get you into a really bad situation also. While texting you will take your eyes off the road and just like that somebody can cross the street or you can run into something. If the call or text is urgent just pull the car over so you can reply or answer and nobody gets hurt.

Cell Phones are really distractive in way that you think you can drive and text but really you are in a bad crash. Your brain can tell you to do one thing at a time and when you try and do both, you panic and that can cause a crash. Both driving and texting needs concentrations so when you try to focus on both your mind gets overwhelmed and you crash. Once you get in the car just put the phone away and out of sight. Focusing on the road is the main key on the road than texting.

Texting while driving is very dangerous. You need your hands for texting so that requires you to take your hand of the wheel and the car can not be controlled. Not having a controlled car can lead to accidents. Being distracted is the main point by how dangerous texting and driving is. Texting and driving is so dangerous that is way more severe than a drunk driver.

Finally, with proven facts, texting and driving is the most dangerous thing to do. There is so many lives getting costed just so you can send a message. Texting and driving is also against the law so unless you wanna pay, put the phone away. Put the phones away because you can hit anybody loved ones and actually kill them and you wouldn't want the same to happen to you. Putting the phones away is saving one life at a time.",1
"Phones and Driving

I think that people should be able to use their phones while driving even though it's dangerous. If that person is responsible and can pay attention while driving and looking at their phone once in a while then it should be fine.

Phones are a key part of our life, we use it for everything we need but some people can't be away from their phone for a minute and that can be a problem if there driving people. They could get in a car cash a severely injure someone and also put there life at risk or maybe even kill someone. As long as that person is responsible and can pay attention to the road while on their phone it shouldn't be a problem.

What if there's something really important that you need to handle on your phone and your on the road you can drive and handle your business at the same time instead of waiting until later where you might forget about it later and what if you get a phone call or a text from someone and its important and you can't answer or text them later.

These are some of the reasons I think people should be allowed to you use their phones while driving and some of the reasons and risk of using your phone while driving. I don't think it should be illegal because that's too much because you never know what people got going on these days.

"In my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cellular devices while operating vehicles it increases the rate of car accidents. I also think that there should be a law to completely band cellphone usage while driving. Cell phones are a big distraction while driving because many want to answer a text or a call right then and then they'll lose focus on driving. Drivers should be alert, paying attention to the road to prevent an accident from occurring. If drivers would keep their phones out of their hands while controlling a vehicle it would be fewer car accidents. Many new cars today have phones that are hands free and that is a lot safer than most cell phones. Despite the risks, the majority of teen drivers ignore cell phone driving restriction because they just think they are so cool and they know what they are doing until they get into a car accident. Using cell phone while driving has caused many car accident, many don't understand how distracting a phone can be. Also when texting while operating an vehicle will cause you not to look at the road. So you cant see what's coming or around you. So if you texting or talking on the phone while driving you not paying attention.

Operating a moving vehicle while driving takes your eyes off the road and many people when both hands for the phone. Many today are taught how to drive with two hands and if trying to talk while driving they take one hand off the wheel to hold the phone which makes the steering wheel feel more heavier that will cause you to lose the wheel. Also for those who try to hold the phone between their head and shoulder it puts them physically off balance and makes the phone more prone to drop. Which your mind and bodies first reaction would be to pick it up, making you take your eyes off the road. It only takes a quick second for an accident to happen. The first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is considerate to other drivers. When people use their cell phones on the highway or on a city road, their driving tends to become lousy. Someone pulling out in front of your vehicle, not letting you merge into adjacent lane. The driver ahead of you slowing down to text or call, and not acknowledging other drivers and pedestrians at intersections and parking lots. When a driver slow down to text or make a phone call, they are taking their attention away from the road which leads multiple ways to end up in an auto crash. No texts or calls is worth a bad crash on the highways and roads. It is not good to use a cell phone while driving because it can cause you to not let another car to merge into a lane, Then they'll pull out in front of you and it could be dangerous.

You don't have a reason to be looking at your phone and driving because their are alternatives you can buy an Bluetooth device that can go in your ear you just have to press an button. Some companies had begun manufacturing hands-free devices that allow you to drive carefully and still be able to answer calls at the same time. You should take that into consideration everyone should drive safe and be careful. In conclusion, You should not use a phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, Because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, And because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answers calls or text when you are going shopping, To work, To a friends house or whatever you may be doing, Consider the consequences.",1
"Cell Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become part of our social culture. These devices are used to send calls or texts to our friends and family members. However, we do not notice the dangers that cell phones pose when someone is driving behind the wheel.

Texting while driving has become a phenomenon in our society as we see more people dying because they do not put their phones down. We do not realize that they distract us when we drive causing so many vehicular accidents that could have been prevented in the first place. Drivers should not use their cell phones as they become a distraction on the road.

One of the main reasons that make using our cell phones while driving very dangerous is that it reduces your reaction time. Let's say that you are driving and you receive a text from a friend. You do not become aware that a car in front of you has stopped that you do not have enough time to react to hit the brakes. Limited reaction time leads to a dangerous car crash. We do not realize that looking at our phones more than your driving can lead to a fatal car accident where your life can end in the matter of seconds.

Teenagers in our society use their phones to record videos where they end up on social networks such as Snapchat. It has become a trend to record themselves driving behind the wheel without thinking about the consequences that comes with them. Constant phone use when driving has created an unsafe environment where we see young drivers becoming more addicted to their phones rather than focusing on going home safely. Recording a video for Snapchat not only endangers you , the driver, but your surroundings such as pedestrians, your fellow passengers, and other drivers. We must think more about the dangers that we create when we record a video by thinking about what could go wrong. Think about the lives that would be destroyed . This is another reason why accidents happen because many people, especially young teenagers , tend to become careless that they would prefer social media over maintaining control on the steering wheel.

How do we control our cell phone use when we are driving? We need to put our phones away and focus on the road. "" Don't text and drive"" messages seen on billboards are there to remind you and other drivers that it is not a safe using your phone while driving. Other road signs contain a "" drive home safe"" poster for this reason. We cannot risk our lives for an electronic device. We have families that are waiting for us to come home safely.

Distracted driving has become a hot topic in many states such as Georgia where we have a ""hands-free law."" It is illegal to have a cell phone when operating a motorized vehicle. We need to raise more awareness about our cell phones and driving that many posters shown in highways reminds drivers of the dangers they face. Informational commercials with drivers on their cell phones depict their lives where they show that being distracted by these hand-held devices can cause a fatal accident. And that we might not make it home safe . Not only do we have to be tough on drivers, but we have to remind them that we have families . And some of them may never see us again for not putting our phones away.

"Phones play a key role in people keeping in touch with one another and accomplishing daily goals and reminders at hand. Driving is a complex task that requires your full and undivided attention, which is a reason why phone use while driving is illegal. In reality, you can make an exception to certain situations when it comes to phone use while driving. These exceptions include emergencies whether it be family or work related, and life of death situations. GPS so people can efficiently and effectively get to and from unfamiliar destinations. Also, some people use their phones as agendas and set daily reminders and goals to accomplish on the daily.

Therefore, people should be able to use their phones while driving.

Cellular devices can be used for many things in a vehicle such as emergency calls. These calls may be work related if you have a on call job. For example, being an on call doctor you would need your phone no matter the circumstances if the hospital needs you. There are other emergencies like if your child was calling because he/she were to be stranded somewhere. Phones may be needed for all types of emergencies.

While driving vehicles, many use their cell phones for gps. Gps is used for getting to unknown locations. Not only is it used to get to unknown places, many also use it to get from unknown places. Gps can help in so many ways. It helps when you're lost and need to find your way around.

Cell phones can also be used for daily reminders to get you through the day. When driving these reminders can tell you if you have to be at a place at a certain time. For example, these reminders can remind you if you are losing track of time and have to pick your child up from school. They can also help if you have errands you need to run and forget what you have to do. These reminders and agenda helps you accomplish goals on a daily.

In conclusion, we use our phones in many ways while operating a vehicle. We use these cellular devices if there is an emergency. Cell phones can get you to and from unknown places. Additionally, they can also remind you about things throughout the day. Therefore, cell phones should be used while operating a vehicle.",1
"Texting while driving should or shouldn't?

Should people be able to drive and hold a phone in their hand? Well, I believe not, people need to be focused on the road ahead and not be all up inside their phone as in don't be texting while driving. This can guide to a whole lot of trouble with people and your car.

Operators who have fatal damages in a year are measured in the tens of thousands, and approximately 2.5 million are gravely hurt or forever disabled. The United States has more than 220 million licensed drivers, and they risk their lives every time they enter as a driver or passenger seat. If you're texting while operating a vehicle then you're not paying attention and that could lead to you connecting to someone leading to their death or someone getting seriously injured.

What the majority of people don't think about is the cost. People or corporations lose money because of thoughtless driving. For instance, accidents caused by cellphone usage leads to big pickup trucks or cause company trucks to drop loads on loads of equipment leaving to great money loss. This can also make a big financial deficient if the truck was hit now we have to pay for damages. This can also lead to bad news if the operator is hurt. If the goods that the driver is haling is damaged or broken that can lead to more money to replace the loss of the haul. The highest price we pay for car crashes is in the loss of human lives, nonetheless, auto industries make steady improvements in vehicle safety over the last several decades but in the year 2014, nearly 32,675 deaths were documented.

In my final judgment, I suppose we can drive safly on our roads without having accidents. Yet I do know that the nature of a human being makes mistakes throughout there lifetime and in those types of situations should be resolved in a courtroom. Furthermore, people who don't follow the law of not texting while driving should have the permits suspend, but we all know that too much of a hassle to deal with. But we need to keep our selves, community, and people protected from harm's way to avoid these types of situations.",1
"Most people in the world own a phone it is often helpful and it is used for numerous hours throughout the day. This is a good resource to use every day but technology has weakened our connection with others because it disconnects everyone from the physical environment. Many phones could be a risk when used during the road, highways, turns and hills.

The used of cell phones on the road have killed many people, it decreases their concentration and lack of driving.

In fact, Cell phone used on the car could be helpful, to take you somewhere or to look up something to eat nearby but all this actions will decrease your focus on the road, drivers should always be ready before their off in the road. It is much safer if everyone plans before leaving the house, it will improve the community. The longer the call or the more emotional the conversation is, the more the driver concentrates more on the call rather than on her or his own driving. There is a risk to every second you take your eyes off because you'll never know what will happen.

Car crashes happen very often around the world, injuries and also death. Drivers should drive with two hands to have more control to the vehicle. Cell phone use is the leading cause of all crashes on the road. Awareness is very important at all times when on a car. Accidents will result economic cost. Paying for cost of collision, losing your job paycheck. There are many side effects to this problem. Phones will distract you from seeing road signs along the way. Not all people can multitask and that's a main problem why people lose concentration on the road.

The hand held law is very important to every driving community, it is necessary for many users. The law must be combined with warning about the dangers of hands-free calls if not it can create a dangerous behavior. Many are at this risk today. Be aware when you want to make or take a call, it can take your life. Many people could be saved at the moment you stop the lack of driving due to your phone",1
"Should we operate a cell phone while driving?

Operating a cell while driving has always been a problem nationwide .The amount of people who think its ok operate a cell phone is ridiculous. The national safety council reports that 1.6 million crashes happen each year because of a person using their cell phone while driving. Most of the reasons why there is so many crashes is people can't wait to text their friends and end up getting distracted. Which leads them to hitting something or someone it's just sad that people can't wait to text their friends.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 meters per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you. Other figures suggest that someone dumb enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.

My conclusion is that every time you drive while using your cell phone. You not only put yourself in danger but you put the people around you in danger as well I rather see you live another day. We all know it's tempting sometimes to cheek if we got a message or who is calling us but that little second can change your whole life. That's why some people recommend you turn off your phone or put you phone on vibrate so that you won't be to tempted to pick up your phone. Look driving in the highways is dangers because of all the accidents that happen and by you using your cell phone makes it more dangers then it already is. The phone can easily be replaced if dropped or squashed but a live human being cannot.",1
"Phone & Driving

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is so dangerous. Driving while using a cell phone could cause many accidents and maybe others on the road lives. Using cell phones while driving is illegal but everyone does it and it could cause problems..

Driving while using cell phones is known all over the world. There are no less than 75 percent of drivers nominated not only ignoring mobile phones rules while driving but texting as well. People using their phones an any case could cause themselves in trouble, harmed, or probably dead.

The reason why people are using their phones while driving because of the psychological aspect. Not only adults doing it also teenagers are driving and using their cellphones and driving too. The young adults had got to the point that they have to respond back to a text or a call, that they need to learn that a long-awaited response from a text or call does not mean rejection all of the time. The average time people eyes are off the road while texting and driving is a total of 5 whole seconds. In just one second, something could happen. Distracted driving is incredibly dangerous.

Driving while using cell phones is a problem that everyone has and need to learn how to adjust that. This requires adults and young adults to be aware to be safe while driving and not use their phone while driving. So adults and young adults, be aware to use your time wisely because that one look at your phone could end up being your last..",1
"There are a variety of reasons why people should be able to use their cellphones while driving. One reason situation in which drivers would need to use a cellphone is for driving directions. Another reason to use a cellphone while driving would be for an emergency situation, then last would be to report a hazardous road condition.

Nowadays people are using the new and upcoming driving apps Lyft and Uber. For a driver to know where to pick up and drop off a person who needs a ride. People also love to visit new places and state attractions. For tourists they often uses google maps or cellphone GPS. It's never a good thing to have the phone in your hand or in your cup holder while driving so that's why companies have made phone holders that are placed on the windshield of the car so that you can always keep your eyes on the road while driving to your next destination.

Another reason for use for cellphones while on the road would be for emergencies. Most people have family out of state and many parents worry about their children who attend college out of state and would love to hear from them at any chance they get. Let's take a newlywed couple for example. The husband is on his way to work while his pregnant wife is home resting next thing she knows her water breaks and is on her way to the hospital. When she reaches the hospital she calls him immediately and now he is on route to the hospital.

Lastly most cellphones are used to contact state or highway patrol to alert them about highway safety related non emergencies. Like if there was a highway/road block or a really bad traffic jam. Most of the time they call highway patrol for vehicle breakdowns/problems, accidents, hazardous material spills, or other highway hazards/problems, as well as impaired or aggressive/reckless drivers and other criminal behavior.

So having a cellphone at your fingertips isn't so bad. Talking on your cellphone while you drive can certainly lead to distraction and accidents but having a cellphone in your car can be very useful in an emergency situation. So the next time you talk on the phone be careful on how you go about it.",1
"Texting while driving

Is it really that important? A text is not more important than your own life. So, what is you lose you job or your boyfriend/girlfriend or an interview, there is always a better job and lover, but no such thing as a life that's better than yours. Just one look can change everything. States in the United States are making laws that prevent you from having your phone in your hands, lap, or chest. While texting while driving is illegal in 47 states, its hasn't stopped some drivers from doing so. Not only are they putting their own life on the line, they risk others too. So, the next time you coming from work, late night, in your feelings, texting your ex how you want them back, blasting Marvin's Room and Jungle by Drake, just remember that you can't get your ex back when you aren't able to walk or worse deceased.

Texting while driving is a serious matter. Lives are at risk due to someone wanting to send just one letter to their friend. Since when was texting your friend more important than living to see them again. Some don't even text they just scroll on Instagram to see what's happening. If we still had flip phones and no touch screen people would just answer a call which is better but still risky because you take your focus off the road. Texts aren't gonna kill you if you don't text back, your mom will understand.

In 47 states texting while driving is illegal, but only few have made it illegal to have your phone in your hand or on you body while driving. The state of Georgia, July 4th, when they in-forced that law they racked up more that 35,000+ tickets in one day and that says a lot. If every state did the same, they would most likely accumulate one million 500 thousand tickets in one day. That's a lot of lives on the line, but people act as if they are masters of texting and driving. Little do they know.

Phones are a problem in the car. Car crashes have rocketed up dramatically since phones have been introduced. 2007 was the time the iPhone came to be and that was the beginning of something great to turn into a disaster. I read in an article that said; ""American will participate in almost 42 hours a week of seated leisure activities by 2030"". People don't pay attention where they are going or what they are doing when they are on their phone because they looking down and so focused on their phone. I bet if the world was ending most would even know unless they saw it on their phone, but by the time they knew it would be too late. Phones are one worst cause of death due to the lack of attention to everything else on this earth.

Look, your phone isn't your life remember that. Not everything revolves around it. A kid want to live to use a phone and drive a car, how about you put the phone down and give them that chance. If you don't have a chance with that girl, don't ruin somebody else's. You phone is always there, and that text might be too, plus you can always get a new phone, but you can't get a new life on earth. Put the phone down and live you life to the fullest, not to the shortest.",1
"Phones & Driving

With everything being at the tip of our fingers with our phones, we often find ourselves distracted and overly invested with our phones not even realizing we do it. Using technology is becoming more and more common there are a lot of benefits when it comes to using cellular devices. When there is something positive it can also be used negatively. We shouldn't be able to use our phones while driving because you are far more likely to get into an accident, someone could kill you or you could kill someone else while doing it, and it is illegal to do.

It is scientifically proven that people are unable to multi-task. When you are on your phone and driving you aren't completely focused on the road leading to you crashing into someone or something. When using your phone, you lose your awareness on the road making you valuable to being in a crash. Using your phone while driving and crashing is becoming more common. Putting your phone on do not disturb or letting the person you are texting or calling know that you are about to get on the road can prevent a crash. Waiting to answer or respond to texts or notifications can wait to lose or risking your own life or someone else's is not worth it.

According to TeenSafe, 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving on any given day and 2.35 million people in the United States are injured or disabled by these car crashes each year. These numbers will only increase year by year if we don't obey laws and regulations pertaining to texting and driving. Despite these number of tragedies, drivers still continue to risk their own lives and others. Even using your phone at a stop sign or at traffic light is dangerous and it should not be done. Just taking one look down at your phone could risk you your life or theirs. We might think that looking down once would be a harmless act, but it puts a strain on attention while driving. The reason why some might text, and drive is because they might have done the harmful act before and gotten away with it and that gives them the confidence in doing it over and over again. People begin to ignore that actual risk of texting and driving and do it over and over again which could ultimately lead to something fatal and dangerous.

In most states they have placed numerous laws about texting and driving and most of them could lead the person to jail time. In the state of Georgia, we have recently passed a new hands-free law, which makes it illegal to be on your phone at all even if you are just holding it. It is even illegal to text while stopped at a traffic light or if you are stuck at traffic. If caught by law enforcement, you could be fined $50 on your first offense and one point on your driver's license. The cost and points taken off increase as you keep doing it which could lead to jail time. And if you get into an accident and it ends in a fatality it could lead to charges of murder with years of jail time. You are still able to use Bluetooth or hands-free calling, but it is still recommended not to use any cellular devices at all because you are not fully focused on the road ahead of you.

In all do not risk your life or others due to a ding or buzz from your phone. Do not be the reason someone loses their own life your takeaway your life because you cannot resist the urge and be patient and wait until you are out of the car to respond or look at your phone. No one wants to be ticketed or sent to jail just because you picked up your cellular device. It is not worth it, and it can wait. We must find some self-control as it becomes harder to contain ourselves from using our phones. With ways such has turning off our phone, putting it on do not disturb or even putting your phone in the backseat.",1
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many people use their cell phones while driving their cars, it's dangerous and people need to realize that if you use your phone while driving it could cost you your life.

Texting while driving is a risky game to play, especially when you're in a really busy city. Everyone knows how dangerous it is but some just don't care, but if you do care then listen up. Texting and driving should not be allowed for anyone especially the teens who just started driving. The teenagers really need to stay off their phones while driving because they are new to it and won't be able to handle the consequences of a wreak. Wreaks are terrible some people end up losing their life, and that's mainly caused by texting and driving. People need to be careful when driving even if they don't own a cell phone, be aware of your surroundings.

If you are on your cell phone in a vehicle and you are operating said vehicle, please put your phone down and be aware of the consequences of your actions. Driving is difficult enough but texting and driving is even beyond more difficult. Texting and driving is a terrible thing to do when there are lots of people around and you never know what could happen next. Texting and driving can be a very dangerous thing that you can do.

People of all ages should not be allowed to use any electronic mobile device while they are driving because of all the risks and dangers that could happen. Everone should know that you shouldn't because of all the times that it's been on the news. People should listen to all the warnings and stuff they put out there.

In conclusion texting while driving should not be allowed in any way, shape, or form. Texting and driving will always be dangerous to the person whose doing it and to the others around them.",1
"The dangers of using a phone while driving

Drivers should not be able to use their cell phones while they are driving. So many things can happen you can get in a car accident and lose your life or take someone else's life. There shouldn't be any reason to use your phone in the first place, your eyes should focus on the road only. Driving is no joke you have to worry about everyone around you. It is the person's job who is behind the wheel to make sure everything is safe. Driving itself is a dangerous thing to do and using a phone as well is not a smart thing to do. Cell phones can make you not focus on what's around you when you are in the vehicle.

Cell phone use while operating a vehicle has became a leading cause of car crashes over two decades. Using cell phones increases the drivers risk of causing a car crash drivers attend to get distracted while picking up the phone. Awareness is key when on the road drivers who don't have awareness leads to accidents. The police can pull you over if they see you using a cell Phone there can be some serious consequences if a police officer pulls you over. It is almost common for someone to crash while they are on their phone. The only time you can use your phone is if you got into an accident or when you get out the vehicle to go somewhere.

Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is mostly considered dangerous due to distracted driving and crashes. Voice calling can also cause accidents because the person is focused on talking to the person instead of focusing on driving. People should just stop using their phones 24-7 and just put the phone down. A phone call can always wait until you reach your destination or when you get out of the vehicle. You don't want to get a ticket over being on your cell phone because cops are always watching to see if you are on a phone.

So next time when you get inside a vehicle you should not use a cell phone it is dangers and dumb. If you get a phone call just wait until you are safe or when you are away from others so you wont make them be in danger. Your life is worth more than just a phone call we have lost way to many people over this and it's time to make a change.",1
"Phones and Driving

Over the past decade, cell phones have become a major issue behind the wheel. Many people don't understand the dangers it holds and how often they risk their life when they grasp that phone while driving. It is extremely hard for a person to multitask behind the wheel, they already have enough to pay attention to considering they're handling a two ton bullet. Not only is your life in danger when you use a cellphone while driving but others lives are too. Phone use while driving should be permitted at all times.

Life is precious. It should not be thrown away by a mistake that is always preventable. No text or song is more important than your, or others, life. Over the past decade, statistics for car accidents by distracted drivers has skyrocketed, roughly now about 1.6 million per year.

Recent research has shown that you are six times more likely to get into a car accident when texting, rather than driving drunk. People know this too, and they still attempt to send that text and believe nothing is going to happen. People already get distracted by their surroundings, why add another distracting and risk someone's life?

Most states have banned cell phones on the road, you can not touch them while driving.

It's called the ""Hand-held Ban"", it has been applied in most states of the U.S. It was recently applied to Georgia in the month of July. These hand-held bans have proven effective, in states around the country the ban was put in place and within a year, we have been shown a difference.

People seem to rely on their mobile devices for just about everything these days, there are ways around this, when in need to navigation just put it on speaker or mount it to the windshield.

There are definitely ways to still get what you need without breaking the law.

In conclusion, texting and driving has proven to take life after life. Even for innocent people just walking alongside the road and following the rules. The people who end up hurting or killing these innocent people have to live with it for the rest of their lives. Don't be that person, it is not worth it. It's not even worth it to get something as minor as a ticket. Cell phones use while driving should be permitted at all times.",1
"Phones and Driving

Cell phones are all around the world. Driving is very common around the world too. Texting while driving is illegal in the United States. It is very dangerous. Even driving while on the phone is very dangerous. It can cause accidents. It can lead to death. Sometimes the after effect are worse. Some people may need their device as part of their profession. Using a device while driving shouldn't be allowed.

According to reports distracted driving is the number one cause of car collisions. The most distracting thing was cellphones. A person trying to send a text or answer his or her phone is the leading cause for car accidents. (https://seriousaccidents. com/legal-advice/top-causes-of-car-accidents/).

Deaths from car accidents caused by texting and driving are insane. There are about 3,500 deaths each year. In 2015 there was over 400,000 injuries from texting and driving. That is more than drunk driving. Pedestrians are killed more than vehicle operators. Nearly 6,000 pedestrians were killed by distracted drivers on their phones. (https://www. millerandzois. com/texting-driving-statistics. html).

The after effects of a car accidents is sometimes worse than the actual accident. Being injured cause stress. Sometimes people can't sleep at night because they get dreams and they don't want to relive that traumatic experience. The lack of sleep can cause more issues with health.

On the other hand using devices while you drive if it's your job is acceptable. Driving people around such as Uber and Lyft is an exception because you have to be on your phone for directions. Being a business owner or a lawyer is very difficult because you have to able to answer your phone.

Being on a device while operating a vehicle is very dangerous. You shouldn't do it. It can lead to death in worst scenario. It can be stressful to families and victims. Texting and driving the number one cause of death by accident. In some cases it is alright to use them, but you shouldn't be on them all the time.",1
"To begin with, I strongly believe that phone shouldn't be used while driving. The reason I say this, is because using a phone while driving can be a big impact on us today. For an example, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident, Georgia is a hand free state and lastly it's a distraction.

First off, phones shouldn't be used because it can cause an accident. The usage of phones is way too high to be used while driving. Did you know teenagers are having accidents because of these phones? The death rate went up because of using a phone while driving seems to be more important than our lives.

Another reason why phones shouldn't be use is because Georgia is a hand free state. You can end up with a glove department fool of tickets because of this phone problem. Now you have to come out the pocket to pay this ticket when you could have obeyed the law. This play a large roll because you can't stay of your phone to save lives. This play a large roll because the law is trying to save lives.

Last but not least, the phone is a huge distraction to the people who is driving. I say this because I seen it with my own eyes that a phone can distract a person. In the blink of the eye you might end up swerving around a car or probably worse. Also this can be prevented if the diver ignores everything on the outside. I mention this because if the diver does this the death rate might decrease.

In conclusion, driving with a phone can have a large impact on us today. Also driving with a phone is a dangerous game to be play at any age.

Why phones should or shouldn't be used while driving?",1
"Eyes on the Road

The creation of smartphones and other communication devices has greatly shaped the human world of innovation; just as the creation of automobiles shaped the transportation community. However, when those two creations cross, disaster is expected. Thousands of car crashes occur a year in the United States alone due to distracted driving due to phones and other communication devices. Driving with phones increases the risk of distraction on the road and endanger surrounding drivers.

Distractions are inevitable when on the road. However, if it can be prevented, it should. There has been about 400 fatalities alone in Georgia due to distracted drivers. Car accidents are extremely preventable when the source of the accident is phone usage.

Of course there are a set of laws in place to find a way to still talk to a person on the phone with hands-free devices but the driver's focus is still limited. The hands-free merchandise and laws are primarily meant for GPS'; in which the usage of phones while driving is permitted. However, that is the only reason a person should be using their electronic devices while operating an automobile. Any other circumstance endangers the distracted driver and the people around him or her.

In this day and age of technology and innovation, a text message or phone call can wait when the lives of thousands are on the line. It is hard enough driving from one place to another worried about getting into an accident, the stakes are higher when drivers are distracted with their cellular devices. It is time to eliminate the usage of phones while driving in order to save thousands of lives.",1
"The Dangers of Phones and Driving

The number of fatal crashes caused by cell phone distracted driving in 2017 was 434 (""Facts and Statistics: Distracted Driving""). The amount of fatal accidents from the use of cell phones while driving has only gotten worse through the years. Ever since cell phones have become more advanced and more popular, the danger has increased. It is hard enough to stay focused while driving but phones make that task 10 times as difficult. Even something as simple as changing the song or answering a text for a split second while driving can put yourself and others at risk.

Teens play a big part in all of this, being the most likely to use cell phones on the road. Teenagers are not as experienced drivers and think that driving is a task they can take with ease. Although driving might come easy for some, that does not give room to be distracted. I personally witness cell phones being used on the road daily. My mom and my dad both use talk-to-text while driving and my boyfriend holds his phone in one hand while driving with the other. My friend and I almost got into an accident the other day because she was using her phone. Nowadays society is far too attached to technology, especially phones. Not only are teens learning that using phones while driving is acceptable from their parents, they also think that breaking the law is nothing to stress.

In mosts states it is illegal to even have your cell phone in your hand let alone be using it or talking on the phone while driving. If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be. When someone decides to use their phone while driving they are not only putting themselves at risk, they are endangering every other person on the road. If they look away from the road for even one second and become distracted, they could crash into another person. There could be children in the car that die from the crash, or a pregnant woman. Lives are constantly at stake while in the car, being distracted only makes things worse.

Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (Cell Phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts, teendriversource. org). Teenagers just starting to drive and adults already driving should take preventative measures to be more safe on the road. They could finish a call or text before they begin driving, leave the phone alone while stopped, and put the phone on silent or do not disturb when driving. Most phones now have a driving more that will mute notifications and send a text back to inform the person they are driving. Even if someone is not driving they can still help. If they call someone who happens to be driving, they can say they will call them back later at a better time.

Society as a whole can and should be better and form good habits by not using a cell phone while driving. Distracted driving is a serious topic and the deaths need to be decreased desperately. The safety of people's lives are nothing to take lightly. Even if someone does something as simple as changing the song or answering a text, that automatically puts them and everyone around them in danger. We all need to do the right thing by following the law and give up phones while driving.

"Respond at your own risk

Using your phone while driving is illegal because it distracts people from the road. Driving and using your phone is very dangerous because you are taking your attention off the road. Which can increase your risk of crashing into someone or something. This is why drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving.

Using your phone while driving is very dangerous and can increase the chance of an accident jurrasticaly. In 2010 a study was shown that 26% of all crashes were related to using your phone while driving. This shows a quarter of accidents come from people who are distracted by their phones instead of paying attention to the road. Using your phone while driving can not only put the driver's life in danger but everyone around the driver too. This is just one reason why you shouldn't be able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle.

A second reason to not use while driving is that it reduces your brain activity while driving. So even if you are using your phone and paying attention to the road your brain still doesn't work as well while driving. The brain isn't meant for multitasking and texting or holding your phone and talking to someone is a lot of work for your brain. So it slows down the brain activity you are using towards driving and puts it more towards you using your mobile device. This will reduce your reaction time and your full judgement. These are just some of the reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving.

Driving while using your phone is dangerous and can lead to an increase in a crash or misjudgement. Using your mobile phone while driving is illegal for a reason it is dangerous for you and everyone around you. But there will always be people who will use their phone and drive and not get hurt. But using your mobile device increases your chance to get into an accident quite a bit. Use your mobile device before and after you get out of your car not while your in it.",1
"One of the leading causes of distracted driving is Texting and Driving. 26% of all car crashes happen while texting and driving, also texting and driving is the number one leading cause of death in teens. 31% of people in the united states that text and drive. Nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are also injured every day due to texting and driving. More than 42% of teens admit that they text and drive. Texting and driving, makes you take your hand of the steering wheel, your eyes off the road and takes away the point of safe driving. Anything could happen with only one text message like car crashes or hitting someone or both. Teens that drive with someone else in the car could be even more distracting than texting and driving, because usually people who have more people in the car don't focus on the road and most likely won't wear a seatbelt. People usually use their phone in a car to change a music station, searching the web, updating social media and texting.

Texting and Driving has been illegal since November 1st, 2015, if caught texting and driving you could serve prison time, license suspension, fines and higher auto insurance. You could serve up to 30 days in prison for using your phone on the road. Texting and Driving is a habit and there are some apps parents could use to monitor the amount off miles, notification blocking and text and call blocking. Some phones are programmed to not allow access while driving but it doesn't mean people still can't get on their phones, usually phones have a notification and asks if you're a passenger and if you hit yes, you could still use your phone. The Newest iPhones are trying to get people to stay off their phones while driving by not allowing to let drivers access their phone. Most newer cars have a button where you could make calls through the car instead of picking up your phone to text someone.

Although people will never stop texting, I believe there is a way to minimize cell phone use while driving. By putting your phone out of reach for people to get tempted to turn on their phone and it will minimize the habit of using phones. Also by turning the phone on silent, so the person driving doesn't hear it and want to pick it up to check and see what it is. People should learn to break their habits from their phones, most people who see or hear their phone then they pick it up. While on the road, everyone wants for everyone else to drive safe so they could get to point A to point B without getting a crash by unsafe drivers, so I believe if everyone wants to remain safe and to get to their destination, they should just not use it while driving. More ways to not be distracted on the roads are keeping the radio on one station, turning their phone off while driving and driving without passengers.

"Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that.

Let's start with texts, social media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rearview mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.

As for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road, take the call, and then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car.

Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.

Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.",1
"Texting & Driving

Texting and driving is against the law. It's very dangerous and has caused many accidents and deaths in the world. Being distracted on your phone while driving is not only unsafe for you, it also puts other people around you in danger.

The guilt you will feel from taking a life by texting and driving could be unbearable. Knowing that you killed someone from texting and driving would be so devastational. The fact that you could of prevented the accident by just paying attention to the road makes the accident so much harder to deal with. Distracted driving incidents are easy to avoid; just don't use your phone while driving. Thinking about the damage you would cause from a car accident, will make you pay attention to the road.

Distracted driving is dangerous for everyone around you. There are many consequence to texting and driving. Fatal accidents is the worst outcome of them all.

Another incentive to not do it is the fine or the incarceration you may receive. Being distracted behind the wheel is one of the biggest issues on the road.",1
"According to The National Safety Council, ""the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"".

My opinion is that they should not be able to use cell phones in any situation while operating a vehicle. I think this for multiple reasons such as they can get into an accident, they could harm someone else, and they could easily take a life out of this world.

My first reason why I think they should not be allowed to use cell phones is because it could lead to a car accident with someone else. For example, on the News 24 website the driving states this, """"I was trying to get my phone on the bed behind me. It was ringing. I did this while I was driving. I'm sorry about this I should have stopped the truck."" This shows that many people don't think about their surroundings within the reality and rather have their phones.

My second reason why is because they could harm someone else. It is proven that nearly 390,00 injuries happen during accidents that involve the use of cell phones. For example, an article on livestrong. com states , ""traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for American teens, and when it comes to distracted driving, young people are among the most likely to text and talk behind the wheel."" This proves that many accidents harm other people when the collision happens or within the next few days after the collision.

While some may say they need it for if their family is having an emergency and they had to make a quick phone call, you should still need to think about others and your surroundings and not just yourself.

Today, many states within the United States are making it a law to drive with a phone in your hand and can take you to court and write you a ticket for driving with a phone in your hand. Do you want to be in an accident with someone who was on their phone?",1
"No Phones Allowed While Driving

Today, many people both own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. So much so, that many have developed the tendency to do so while operating a vehicle. This current trend of behavior among drivers has caused a series of debates as to whether or not one should be allowed to use their phone while driving. Due to the many risks that come with a distracted driver. Thus, why drivers should not be allowed to operate cell phones while operating a vehicle.

While operating a vehicle, it is important for drivers to stay focused on the road. However, cell phones are one of the most common causes of distracted driving related accidents. (The Most Common Causes of Distracted Driving). According to 4 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Text and Drive by B City of Bryan, ""Five seconds is the minimal amount of time your attention is taken away from the road when you're texting and driving."" In addition, it generally only takes a driver about five seconds to travel the length of a football field when traveling around 55mph. This means that when drivers become distracted by their cell phones, they create a large window of opportunity for disaster to strike.

In most cases, people think that they can keep their eyes on the road while operating their cell phone at the same time. In contrast, drivers who allow themselves to get distracted by their cell phones increase their chances of getting into an accident, as well as putting themselves and many others life's at risk. For example, a distracted driver is, ""...23 times more likely to be in an

Hearing 2 accident,"" than a non-distracted driver. (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration). To continue, ""texting while driving is to blame for... 1,600,000 accidents per year, 330,000 injuries per year, and 11 teen deaths every day."" (National Safety Council, Harvard Center for Risk Analysis Study, Institute for Highway Safety Fatality Facts). Therefore, it is proven that a distracted automobilist is a hazard for not only themselves, but also other motorists and pedestrians.

Furthermore, due to all the costly risks that come with texting and driving, such action has been made illegal in many states. Andrei Zakhareuski, from Driving Tests, proclaims that, ""Those who are caught will be issued a citation by a policeman who will most likely be quite perturbed at the driver's ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident sites...,"" and believes that, "" ... A text message that reads ""ok"" isn't worth a couple hundred dollar fine."" Not to mention, those involved in a distracted driving related accident risk jail time, and most certainly, an increase in insurance rates. According to, 10 Pragmatic Reasons That Will Make You Stop Texting and Driving Today, ""If texting and driving is included in the police report for an accident or wreck for which you are held responsible, you'll notice an even more significant rate increase. In some cases, your policy might be dropped completely."" Such a spike in cost or dropping of a policy would severely impact a driver. Hence, texting while driving is not worth the risk.

With the current trend of texting and driving, and all its risks included, drivers should not be allowed to operate cell phones while operating a vehicle. For, texting while driving takes a driver's attention off the road and endangers the lives of any passengers, other motorists, and

Hearing 3 pedestrians. Moreover, texting while driving increases a driver's chances of getting into an accident. As follows, once involved in a texting and driving related accident, either a driver's cost of a premium will skyrocket, or he or she will get dropped from their policy. To conclude, it is not safe nor wise for an automobilist to operate a cell phone while operating a vehicle.

""if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.""

Drivers should not have the chance to be able to use cell phones while in the capacity of operating a vehicle. This should already go without saying that being on your cellular device distracts you from the road and every thing around you so your reaction time to important things will be decreased greatly and you would be more likely to get in an accident. ""Distracted driving is dangerous, claiming 3,450 lives in 2016 alone. NHTSA leads the national effort to save lives by preventing this dangerous behavior.""

We say that driving while using your phone is illegal, but end up using your phones or doing everything else except drive.

""Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed."" Everyone thinks that if they don't text that person or watches the last part of a funny video while driving its going to disappear, when the reality is that its going to be at the same place. ""NHTSA's campaigns and public service announcements make the case to Americans that safe driving means driving without distractions. You've likely seen or heard our public service announcements, but we're also on Facebook and Twitter sharing stories and tips to help save lives."" There are so many people trying to stop texing and driving because it can kill multiple people depending on who got in the accident or around it.

""Your State legislature and governor make the laws regarding distracted driving. Many States now have laws against texting, talking on a cell phone, and other distractions while driving. You can visit our State Laws page to learn about the laws in your State."" As you can see that texting and driving is really serious.

"Cells phones are very common place for everyone to own and use on a daily basis. Cell phones are used by most people in all aspects of their lives which means even when they are operating a motor vehicle. Being distracted by cell phone use while driving can cause injuries and death. Using a cell phone while you are driving takes attention that the driver should be paying to what is going on around them. This split second of attention spent on the cell phone could cause the driver or those around them their lives. People should not use cell phones while driving.

Driving a motor vehicle requires a driver to be aware at all times of what is going on around them. They need to be able to react at a moments notice. If a driver is using a cell phone they will not be placing their full attention on driving and accidents can happen. When a driver is distracted, not only do they put their life in danger, but they also endanger the lives of those on the roads with them.

Sure a cell phone can be a good tool to use for navigational purposes, or a cell phone is great to have in the event of an emergency. The cell phone can help the driver get help quicker than they could in the past because they have instant access to a communication device. The cell phone gives its owner instant access to the Police, EMS, and Fire with the push of a couple of buttons. A cell phone can be a great tool, but it can also be a deadly one. Cell phone use should only be conducted hands free while a person is operating a vehicle in order to cut down on the distraction it can cause.",1
"Is Texting Worth Your Life

In the United States the number one cause of motor accidents are distracted drivers, evidently these are people who text and drive. People know this fact yet accidents due to distraction on ones cell phone still arise in todays generation. Some people think that they are a experienced enough driver to be able to get on their phones and send a text, search the web, or make a phone call. However, studies have shown that it is impossible to focus on two things at once. In the United States 1 out of every 4 car crashes are due to texting and driving.

The National Safety Council reports that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". These statistics are frightening and eye opening to those incompetents enough to believe that they have the ability to text and drive safely. These victims are actually not experienced drivers but are mostly novice drivers. Police reports most of the accidents are caused by young adults. According to a AAA poll ""94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driver, but 35 percent admitted to doing it anyways."" Their young arrogance puts their lives at risk and states like Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, and other states outlawed texting and driving.

The risk that people of any age take when they text and drive is far too great and the laws set in place by those states are meant to protect us like any law should. People might not only hurt themselves, but they can hurt someone else who has loved ones. In conclusion, the final text to a loved one, boss, or friend should not be the last message of your life.

"Phones and Driving

Car accidents seem to have been increasing due to the uproar of phones. More people have become distracted whether it's texting or driving, you're on a phone call, or just being on social media while driving, and with all these action being done while driving it's causing a lot of deaths in car accidents. According to the National Safety Council 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers being on the phone, with 314,000 of those incidents involved text messages. Using the phone while driving is reckless and needs to come to an absolute stop.

As more and more people gain more access to a phone texting and driving (or using the phone regardless) has almost become normal. Young drivers are the most at risk because using the the phone while driving distracts the brains and eyes from driving. Since technology will further blossom in the near future, the best way for teens to learn and prevent car crashes is advice from parents. Parents should talk to their young teen drivers about the safety of driving so they can prevent a car accident of worst. Parents should also avoid calling and texting their child while driving to insure the safety of their teen.

It's not just teen drivers at risk when they're using their phone while driving, adults are at a high risk too. In fact adults are put at a higher risk because studies have shown adults are more likely to use their phone and drive due to them thinking that since they have more experience behind the wheel. Adults are equally responsible behind the wheel just as much as a teen is when it comes to using a phone. In 2012 over 3000 people died in car accidents with someone in either car being a distracted driver. If anything adult drivers should be held more to a higher standard simply because they are older and have to lead by example for up and coming drivers who learn how to drive by watching whatever adult drives them around. Let only it may be more dangerous to an adult driver because 9 times out of 10 they are driving with a passenger or even worse a someone's child or a child of their own. When driving adults should be more careful while being on the phone and driving because they never know who's watching them.

Distracted drivers in this current day in age need to be a lot more careful. Because every day more and more people are now getting on the road and becoming a distracted driver and not being aware of what's going on, on the road around them. All distracted driving needs to come to a halt so everyone can one day and not having to worry about if their teen drivers is going to make it home okay or if they would make it home today.",1
"Phones While Driving: The Dangers

Phones while driving is very dangerous, it causes many wrecks daily and never has good outcome associated with it. Statistics show that cell phone usage while driving is very common for teen drivers. Based on data from the NSC, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging.

Teens today have made cell phone related accidents an epidemic which is why many states have banned the use altogether. Cell phones should never be used while in control of a vehicle.

Laws preventing cell phone use while driving is the best thing to happen to this country.

According to the NSC cell phone use while driving is the top distraction and almost everyone uses their cellphones while driving, almost all the time. By using vehicle data sensors from over three million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of travel time, driving company Zendrive discovered that drivers use their phones on 88% of their time behind the wheel. Average motorists spend about 3.5 minutes using a phone per hour trip, a fact that is even worse when you see that just a two-second text boosts the risk of a wreck by 20%.

Driving a car and talking on the phone both require a lot of thought to perform. By texting and driving at the same time of each other, it is impossible for your brain to do both with 100% accuracy. Just like it's almost impossible to read and talk on the phone. Doing this while driving, often causes crashes because of the delayed stopping times and reactions to traffic signs.

In conclusion, Cell phone use while driving is a bad idea. It hurts many who are involved and is not safe what so ever. If everyone put the phones down and refrain from texting the whole world would be safer. Laws are in place to try to stop texting, you need to do your part to stop this action.

"Phones & Driving

Cell phones and other portable devices are used and carried by almost everyone at almost every time. Technology has pushed us forward, but with us using it everywhere, we are using it in moving vehicles at over 35 miles per hour. Many people ever realize how dangerous it is to text and drive, however its just as dangerous to talk on the phone and drive, hands free tools don't help much either. No driver should use a cellphone mid drive for many reasons.

Cell phones are dangerous, texting to someone on a device while driving is more than dangerous. However it is also risky to Talk to someone on the phone while driving as well ""1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone...""(CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING STATISTICS). The chances of crashing while texting is just as high. Many people who text and drive are teenagers new to driving, and most likely not used to paying attention only on the road. Young people are early to most new technology, and on that technology is social media, a somewhat more elaborate set of texts. Most people may think, oh we can put it on a stand and let a screen reader read it to us and use voice to text cover texting, that is not how it works.

Many People try tools where they can place their phone on like a stand, or bluetooth device, these hands free tools don't always work. Talking to someone is one of the more distracting things a driver can do, ""Talking on a hands-free celluar device ranked in the middle of the spectrum - more distracting than talking to a passenger...""(The evidence on hands-free cell phone devices while driving). Just taking is dangerous enough, however most passengers react to what you're driving towards and will stop. In most conversations with phone users, the person out of the car can not see what is ahead and have a continuously normal speech pattern, making it just as complex on the driver to take as ever. Many people consider this a safer option, despite the fact that there is overwhelming evidence of hands free devices being negative, it is not as spread out as texting and driving warnings. No one should talk on cellular devices and drive, but many people do, most who do are new to driving and just got their licence.

Most people who use cell phones and drive are younger, inexperienced drivers who just got their licence. Many times they are not used to multitasking, especially involving driving, 'Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.',(CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING STATISTICS). When these teens hear their phone ring, they will naturally pick up their phone and answer it, they rarely know what trouble they are getting themselves into. Many teenagers are early to try out new social media websites, applications, or even new mobile devices, they are most of the time the first to use these once they are on the market, and they might be too drawn in by their technology to pay attention to driving. Most teens will learn engaged driving in time, but when they do not know what that is or are not doing it, they can doom themselves. A variety of people drive and use the phone, but a chunk of them are teenagers, but they will grow out of it if they are smart enough to.

Many people text and drive, but more people use the phone and drive, both are equally distracting to the driver but only one is ignored on the road. Some people know that using a cellular device and driving is bad, so they logically do not. However many teenagers use their cell phone and drive, and many people have tried hands free tools and devices. Cell phones never have worked well with driving, and only will when self driving cars are popularized.

"When driving , being on the phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous in many ways. Anything that takes your attention off the road can be a distraction. People die in car accidents everyday because they are distracted with their cell phones. According to research, cell phones is one important leading factor that causes accidents. However, many people will argue that you should have a phone on you just in case of an emergency . cell phones will come in handy when your in a difficult situation when you need to contact the police or an ambulance. Despite that having cell phones while driving in an effective way of communication , using phones while driving results in distractions and distractions leads to accidents or maybe even death.

A main cause of distracted driving is cell phones. Driving while being distracted can be difficult reacting to serious car crashes especially for teens and inexperienced drivers. They tend to distract themselves way easier than the adults . peer passengers have an effect on drivers because they tend to talk on the phone, change the radio, apply makeup, eat or drink and showing you social media while driving. In georgia , Joshua's law state a new driver from age 16-18 must dive with a family member only. But the generation we live in , new drivers get happy when they get their licence and they can't wait to tell there peers to hop in the car with them.

Until you reach the age 25, typically you are still considered as an inexperienced driver. Getting your licence only means that teens have passed the state required practice hours and the on-road test. Even though young adults have basic knowledge of how to navigate there vehicles in high traffic areas and other challenging situations , they still need more practice on the road.

There are numerous ways to prevent car accidents from coming now and in the future. When coming to your car , your cell phone should be put away. They should only be brought out during emergency situations only. Socially talking on the phone will be carried while driving. It is against the law. If you are rundown after a long day or gloomy before while driving, then you should pull off the road. Drowsiness increases the risk of a car accident. If you're feeling like this then you should pull off the road and call someone for help. Limit the number of friends you are allowing into your car. Most states prohibit teens from having their teenage friends passengers in the car during their early months of them driving solo. Driving with your peers can cause a dangerous driving environment because they would not be able to focus on the road. They be more focused with their friends. Parents should help and monitor their child's driving and limit peer passengers with them.

Having to experience driving for the first time can be fun because your learning how to drive. You won't have to rely on your parents or friends that do know how to drive because you will be able to on your own .",1
"There is a huge issue now and days with driving and cellular devices. There has been many reports of texting while driving causing car accidents and many deaths in the past 10 years. People should not be allowed to operate cell phones while driving. Operating a cellular device is a major distraction and does plenty of harm rather than good. These distractions are causing families to lose loved ones and to constantly mourning when these incidents can be avoided.

Texting is one of the main issues when using cell-phones while driving. ""According to The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year."" (edgarsnyder. com) Not only does cell phone use while driving cause crashes it also cause deaths. In the year of 2017 alone it has been reported that 3,477 people have died from distracted driving. These death tolls have only been increasing and it has to be stopped.

Teen distracted driving is even worse than adults. Teens are very distracted in general when it comes to school, relationships, social media,etc. This means that their minds are already running a mile per minute. This causes them to be in high risk of getting into accidents because their full attention is not on the road. On top of this when teens are texting and driving this completely takes their entire attention away from the road and not only puts their lives at risk but also leaves other drivers, pedestrians, and passengers in their cars at risk.

Driving distractions are not only caused by cell-phones there are other factors to consider.

These factors include cognitive, visual, and manual; Cognitive consists of taking your mind off driving. Visual includes taking your eyes physically off the road. Lastly, manual means to take your hands off the wheel. All of these things are normally done in a back to back sequence.

Which cause accidents to occur and vehicles to also become damaged.

Thankfully there have been laws passed recently that are now prohibiting cell-phone use while operating a motor-vehicle. Even though this law has been put into effect drivers are still using cell-phones. The consequence for not adhering to this law is a 100 dollar fine, a ticket, and a bad note on your license. Due to drivers ignoring this law people are continuing to become injured and worse lose their lives. To prevent these horrific things from occuring providers have made a system while driving on the phones that enables a person from receiving messages while driving. With these provisions we should see a substantial difference in the death and injury toll in our communities.",1
"It will kill you, maybe not today, but all it takes is a second. Texting and driving has become the number one cause of car accidents. It is very distracting and it sure does not do any good for anyone. Nothing is as important as someone's life, especially a text message. It can wait until you reach our destination. Using cellphones while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed at all.

Texting and driving seems simple but it is not, it distracts the driver and it puts the driver's life as well as others in danger. In today's society many teen drivers own a cellphone and are constantly on them for social media. Most of these drivers use their phones while driving. According to teensafe. com, 58% of teen crashes has been linked to distracted driving. It only takes three seconds after a driver takes their eyes off the road for a crash to occur. Social media and all the other platforms are such a distraction for the younger generation of drivers and it has led to fatal incidents.

People who use their phones while driving typically use it to text someone or post something on social media and what they don't realize is the dangers of that one text message. When driving, if someone texts you, they can wait until you are not driving for a response. Nothing will ever be more important than being safe on the road while driving, meaning not being distracted. Although calling someone while driving does distract the driver, it is a little safer than texting and driving. As long as the call is bluetooth and handsfree then there is no problem with that being allowed while driving. There should be an exception to that which is that any driver under the age of 18 should not have their phones out at all, not even wireless calling.

Texting and driving has no beneficial outcome, so there is no reason to do it. A distracted driver could get in a car accident and get killed. They could also injure someone else and then be left with the consequences of it. The insurance will be raised very high, there will be medical bills for the injured party that has to be paid, there will be fines to be paid, possible jail time, and suspension of your driver's license. Nothing good comes from texting and driving. The vehicles after a wreck will be damaged and it will just be unnecessary stress and problems added to a driver's life that could have been prevented.

Many states, including California, has already banned the use of cellphones while driving. There is a hands-free law that prohibits having a cellphone in your hands while driving. Distracted driving is never a good idea, no matter how important someone believes the message is. Distracted driving leads to fatal accidents and deaths of many people. Using electronic devices while driving should be prohibited.",1
"Texting and driving has been a growing problem for years now. People should not be allowed to use cellular devices and drive at the same time. 3,637 people died in 2018 alone due to phone related car crashes. 15,341 drivers aged 15-29 were involved in fatal crashes due to distraction or cell phone use. Driving in itself is already dangerous and risky but then you put the additional risk of unneeded distractions it makes it more dangerous.

3,637 people died in 2018 alone because of phone related accidents.

Believe it or not this is one of the lowest recorded numbers in recent history. The National Safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. 1 out of 4 crashes in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Cell phone uses behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving 37 percent.

It's not just teens who text and drive. Adults are just as likely to text message while driving as teenagers.

More than a quarter of U.S adults admit to texting while behind the wheel. At any age, texting and operating a motor vehicle has been found to dramatically increase the chances of an accident. Adults 18-33 are the most likely to admit they text while they drive (59 percent) compared with age groups 34-45 (50 percent) and 46-64 (29 percent).

In conclusion, most car crashes have been caused by texting and driving. Many people have died by texting and driving proved by statistics. Not only do teens do it but adults are also proven by statistics.",1

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis drivers shouldn't use phones while driving. Every day in the world today people die in car accidents because they use phones while driving. People use not use their phones for texting, talking, or internet wise. Unfortunately, people are choosing the wrong time to be using their phones while driving.

Distractions from cell phones cause about 2,600 deaths per year in the United States. In today's world now they have a hand free law where you can't use your phone while driving. They should ban phones while driving because it will keep a safe distance from accidents. Phones can affect the driver in many way such as whenever they are using them while driving like wrecks, slamming on the brakes to hard, or running off the road. Phones make our lives more convenient. When the drivers is texting and driving it takes the forced of the eyes off the road, their hands off the wheel and their minds away from driving. Also talking on the phone while driving is also a serious risks and challenges because it creates multiple distractions. Distractions from cell phones cause about 2,600 deaths per year in the United States.

I think that people shouldn't use phones while driving because it leads to a lot of things such as accidents or car crashes. People that wants to use their phones should pull over to s local store to text or talk on their phones. The only drivers who should be able to use their phones is the drivers that have cause with bluetooth radios. Driving while using phones to drunk driving, in both ways, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity. People that are driving with phones should be punish with a warning or a ticket because they shouldn't be using their phones why driving because that will lead into accidents.

Drivers shouldn't be on their phones while driving because it is against the law. They have penalties for whenever you break a law when in used of phones. The 1st offense is a $50 fine one demerit point which means they just go to court and get dismissed. Phones and driving will increases the risk of injury and death. Especially young divers such as teens get distracted really fast than adults drivers. People shouldn't always depend on their phones because they are not reliable. During emergency situations phones can provide help and the driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous situations like accidents.

People should not use phones during driving. Despite of being an effective way of communication using phones during driving distracts attention of a driver thus increasing road safety concerns. The uses of phones play roles in many ways why people shouldn't use them while driving.

Everyday people die in car accident because of them being on their cell phone while driving. According to a research cell phone are the leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that people that use their cell phone while driving puts the driver at four time greater risk of a crash, but despite the danger people still use their phone because they want to always be in touch with others people. Also people that drive using two hands might be in an emergency test situation and might have to text back using two hands to go faster. Also talking on the phone should be avoided because it's just as dangerous as texting. Other people say that hands free set is safety because people can drive using two hands, but however hands free devices do not take down the risk of causing an accident and it. She have to live with that for the rest of her life knowing she killed someone. So many people driving don't know that they can be doing things wrong without even knowing like talking, texting, and even drinking. Several states have ban the use of cell might even be worse. Also texting and driving doesn't just put you at risk it put the people around you at risk too so you are putting innocent people at risk. A story of a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have indented to end that person life, but she made one of the worst decision someone could ever make phones while driving which I think is a smart thing to do. Americans rely heaving on cell phone for daily tasks. Good ways to prevent getting on your phone while driving is to turn your cell phone off, put your phone on silent , put it in to place where you cannot reach it, send your texts before you start to drive, or just have someone text for you. People should never use their phones while driving because every time you do you put yourself and other innocent people in danger every time you use your phone.",1

Cell phones a tool widely used in our society today. A cell phone has many purposes it can be used for communication, entertainment, and information. Most people have their own cellular devices. All around, it's extremely useful, but can also be very distracting leading to mishaps occurring. Lots of people like you and I have a horrible habit of using our phones, while operating dangerous machinery like automotives. Which increases the risk of accidents occurring. Laws should restrict the usage of cell phones use while driving on the road to prevent accidents from transpiring.

Distractions lead to mishaps happening more often increasing the risk of injury to oneself and others around them. Many people use their cell phones while driving. In fact, ""1 out of 3 people text while driving"" and ""texting while driving increases the risk of crashing by 23 times"" (NHTSA, 2019). Sometimes drivers get distracted but, ""the maximum amount of time a driver can safely divert their attention from the road from is two seconds, it takes a driver five seconds - on average - to send a text message"" and ""82% of American teens have a cell phone. 52% of these teens note that they talk on the phone while driving and 32% text on the road"" (TeenSafe, 2019). Everyday there is an accident and everyday ""11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving"" (TeenSafe, 2019). This loss of life can be avoided if there are regulations limiting the usage of cell phones.

Laws should be kept in place to help prevent the usage of cell phones while driving. With these laws unnecessary loss of life can be avoided, and accidents prevented. Every time someone is distracted on the road it increases the risk of a fatal accident. Many people out there all around should be safe and smart about driving, and the more they do the more lives are not at risk.

Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving a vehicle because when people are on the phone with someone and texting and driving a vehicle they get distracted and not paying attention .The things that can happen when using a phone while driving the person could hurt someone, cause a wreck, hurt them self. When people are engaged in a conversation, be it on a call, texting or even with someone else in the car while there attention is divided. People only have so much attention to spare In fact, with there are very few magic numbers in life, there is a magic number associated with how many things people can attend to at once and it's not a lot. People needs to be consider about their responsibility and other people that are driving and walking. Using mobile devices while driving is dangerous also a hazards. The reasons why using a cell phone while driving is dangerous is because taking your eyes off the road to see who calling and texting you it's cause a distraction and a wreck.",1
"Driving while operating your phone can end in a very horrific way and has for a number of young adults. The number one killer of young adults is motor vehicle crashes. This is a major issue in the United States and it is shown because a law was made to prevent operating a phone and driving. For example, there are billboards everywhere saying no texting and driving and commercials saying the same. Texting and driving may seem tempting to do, but every year thousands of drivers and passengers are killed due to someone being on their phone and driving. It only takes a couple of seconds for you to take your eyes off the road and someone can swerve in your lane or you swerve in someone else's lane and didn't notice because you are texting someone back or looking at a notification. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away.

First, ask yourself if the text or notification you received is more important than your life or than the people on the road with you. If not, put down the phone and wait until you are at a light or until you get to your destination. No notifications are worth someone's life or yours. You can look at the news or on the internet and see just how many young adults' lives are cut short because they wanted to text someone back or make a snap, all of that can wait. Seeing the statistics, the death rates, even some people's friends dead because they couldn't wait to text someone back or make a snap. Just because you got away with it once doesn't mean you should keep trying to do it because all it takes is a couple seconds and then you or someone else is hurt or dead.

Secondly, ""In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists."" All these deaths could have been avoided if the person could have just waited until they stopped or until they got to their destination. Your parents tell you to text or call before you start driving for a reason so they won't lose their child or see their child hurt. ""Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent."" So this shows that texting can make you forget important things you are supposed to do before or while driving.

Lastly, ""Typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles."" This shows that the couple of seconds you take to text or look at your phone can take away the attention you are required to have on the road to ensure safety. Texting while driving could make you miss that there is construction going on, someone is walking, or etc. Parents should not call while their children are driving, they should call before or after they arrive at their destination. If their child is called he is going to look at their phone and some might answer, but all it could take is a look and boom the car goes into another lane or they hit someone or another car.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away. No notification is worth someone's life. You can easily take someone's life young or old by a simple text. Before you start driving, call and text everyone that needs to be called or texted and if they call or text wait until you stop or get to your destination.",1
"Phones and Driving

Drivers should they or should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle? Drivers should not attend to a mobile device while operating a vehicle. This action is the main source of car accidents due to decreasing the drivers awareness on the road causing injury and/or death .

Some states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving to take precaution. Driving distracted is one of the main causes of car accidents over the last two decades. Each year 6 million cases of car accidents take place, which roughly per day is 16,438. About 3 million people are injured or disabled and 6,000 deaths happen annually. According to statistics in 2010 the loss of human lives due to car accidents cost almost 1 trillion dollars, the highest price we pay for the loss of others in the collision of vehicles.

Most states have passed or are passing a law, illegal to use your phone while operating a vehicle. Most states banned use of cell phones while driving are different from others or either similar. For example the state of Georgia banned all drivers under the age of 18 and school bus drivers to the utilization of phones. As in Arizona school bus drivers and learner's permit and existing license holders during the first six months after licensing aren't allowed to operate a mobile device while the driver's vehicle is in motion. Although these states' rules are slightly contrasted from each other, the use of texting, hand held calls, and possession of devices in the palm is prevented.

Cell phones are a very dangerous distraction to you and those around you, but can have its benefits such as navigation and the use for help or assistance. Many cell phones have GPS assistance which provide direction to arrive at your designated destination. Cell phones also allow users to contact aid whether its an ambulance, the police, or help with your car while on the road. Although these actions are very safe they should not be acquired while a vehicle is in motion to prevent any dangerous interactions.

In conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving. Put down your mobile device, the call or text received is worth the wait than worth being in a major or minor accident. Without the distraction your attention is focused on the road and your surroundings. This action taken is safer for you and your environment.

"No Cell Phones Driving

There should be no cell phones while people are behind the wheel. This can increase traffic, cause crashes, and can even get you pulled over. There is no text that is worth the risks that you take by using it while driving. Most may use it for gps but that is something that can be used before you start your car, and it can be put on speaker so you can hear the directions. It can only take one time that you think its ok to pull it out; only for it to cause you time, money, and quite possibly your life.

Using your cell phone while operating a vehicle is also a hindrance on other drivers as well. The phone is a distraction that can slow down the smoothly moving traffic and back things up. Examples are not paying attention to the change of lights while sitting at a red light. That keeps others from moving along with their driving and will cause traffic jams in big cities where cell phone usage is most used. Which in big cities can be a big factor to car crashes

In most states having your cell phone out while driving is illegal for newer drivers and can be punishable with the suspension of your license. For others the punishment can be a fine that goes up to $150 in Georgia which is one of the highest in the country. Having to deal with a fine given and being pulled over can stop you from getting to your destination to a party , meeting, or even just home. Now you run the chance of being late because you needed to check your phone while driving. Even if you are just checking for a split second you open yourself to the risks of your divided attention.

On the other hand people justify the usage of phones while driving a vehicle as an emergency that they can't miss. Sometimes you run into those calls or texts that you just cant miss. Understanding that yes, life does get in the way and some things need urgent reactions. You can just as quickly stop on the side of the road to not only be safer while checking the emergency, but also giving your full attention to the matter rather than half and half. You will be able to safely deal with the emergency that arises calmly as well since you are stopped, such as setting the gps to a new destination if needed, or even finding a new place to eat.

While people think they can use their phones and drive, it's not the smartest idea. Crashes, traffic backups, and fines are all outcomes from using them. It puts not only you in danger but others as well The text or call you miss is not worth what you could pay. The payment could range from money you may not have, or even your or somebody else's life. There are even many commercials talking about this very topic with the simple slogan ""It Can Wait"".",1
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I say that when operating a vehicle that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Some of the reasons are that people use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, or even going on the internet. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Truth be told people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving. We all have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and safety of others because of our phones.

What people should know is that other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Retarded driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of again the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. For example a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. A person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. A more reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In more studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.

In the United States car crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause to distracted driving is cell phones. When drivers talk on the cell phone the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. Drivers using cell phone are not able to give their complete attention.

Lets just think about it everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Moreover, they use argument that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Some businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. What they do not know is that because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident.",1
"Should drivers be able to use a phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle or should drivers not be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle? Using a phone while driving could be helpful in various ways and also could be used in harmful ways. Cell phones can take the attention of a driver causing a risk of danger.

A cell phone helps drivers with immediate roadside assistance, in case of a serious car accident. Cell phone's allow drivers to get directions turn by turn with the helping of GPS technology. Phone cameras are very important in a case of a hit and run accident, it allows a person to take a picture of the license plate. Some insurance companies may require a picture of an accident. Traffic reports update on a phone in minutes, accidents, highway closings and also an estimated travel time to their destination.

An activity that grabs the attention from a driver is Distracted Driving. Being distracted on the road causes fatal crashes. Many jurisdictions worldwide have made calling an illegal act.

However lots of vehicles have hands-free devices, some may say that hands-free activities are not safe. Hands-free still drags away the attention from a driver on the road ""Distracted Driving"". Currently, cell phones are the leading cause of distracted driving. When operating a cell phone while driving increases hospitalization rate four-times higher. Texting increases the rate to 23%

more likely to have a car accident.

Personally, I think cellphones should not be used in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There are many accidents caused by the use of a cell phone. A person who operates a cell phone while driving is not only putting his or herself in danger but also others on the road and pedestrians. Using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is selfish because the lack of control a person has on the road.

My essay provided arguments from both stand points whether drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. On the facts provided throughout my essay, despite the many ways of communication cell phones while driving raise many safety issues. In conclude the bad outweighed the good.",1
"Cell phones have become a important item in today's society.

There have been people who use this item excessively, especially while they drive.

Driving while using cell phones can make the driver less focused, not only on the road but to your surroundings.

Not paying full attention can also slow down your reaction time.

When it comes to cell phones and driving I support the use of them with moderation (use when parked).

Cell phones can benefit the driver in many ways.

They can be used as a gps.

It helps people who are driving alone and can't get someone else to use a paper map.

A phone can be a source of entertainment too.

For those who enjoy songs or podcast that are not normally on the radio.

Most drivers can be distracted by cell phones.

One example is if their phone falls out of the vehicle mount. This action will tempt them to pick it up causing their attention to be taken off of the road which can lead to a car crash.

Another would be holding a conversation with someone one the phone.

Finally sending or reading a text message.

Even though cell phones can provide a driver with options on their experience while riding.

Being able to listen to different types and styles of music.

Also making sure you are going to the proper destination.

It should not be used to the point where it can take you attention off the rode.",1
"Phones and Driving

People who are always driving and on their phone are a danger to the road. The police should crack down on the people who's doing it. In 2018 & 2019 there had been more deaths in the population has went up. Although cell phones have not been around very long and they have become a part of people life its like something very important. They use there people for uses like texting and talking and even playing games. The phones have develop over this and gain new features to them.

Using a hand held cellphone while driving is very dangerous to the person who's driving and to the other people who's on the road. Because it's very difficult for the driver to pay attention to the road. It's make the driver forget they there the only person driving on the highway. Other drivers take note about the other people who is doing this on the highway.

It can make people late for work if there's a car accident on the highway and it was the driver fault for being on there phone. You shouldn't want to risk your life our anyone else life just for a cell phone. They should make track phones for the people who uses them. It only will stop if the driver put a stop to it there self. A usage of a cell phone shouldn't be used on the road.

The cell phones have become an object where you can't keep it out your hand. However the dangers present themselves when they get behind the wheel. That's a bad habit for someone to have. Help other people stay on the road and drive safer.",1
"Phones and Driving

Today in society people all have a cell phone to call, text or explore things that may interest them. They also have access to a vehicle (Car, Truck, RV, Etc.) to which they can drive from place to place. Phones and vehicles are the same since both are a privilege to have and are not a basic human right. The use of allowing one to drive a vehicle while he or she uses a phone is an interesting topic to discuss. Both are also what teenagers are expected to get when they reach the age of 16.

In my opinion I believe that phones should not be used while a driver is driving. Driving is important to reduce time to get from one place to another. It can be dangerous to drive if one does not focus on the road. If someone is driving and they waste a second on their phone they could harm or possibly kill someone for not looking who is in front of them. Driving with a phone or in your lap could even distract you long enough to not get the steering wheel and may worsen one's driving skills.

Also if one decides to drive with their phone they are not just putting everyone else at risk, they're putting themselves at risk as well. According to a statistic 58% of teen crashers are because of distracted driving. Meaning that without the use of their phone more than half of teen crashes would be reduced and less harm would be done. Another study states ""Text messaging increases the risk of crash or near-crash by 23 times."" Meaning that just receiving or glancing at the phone for a second could cause a crash.

However, phones can or should be used only in an emergency. An example is when one needs directions to get to a location that is fine to use the phone. If there is Bluetooth, then connect it to the cell phone if it is compatible to focus more on the road. Or if you need to use your phone just find somewhere to park or stop somewhere and use your phone there. Unless it is for an emergency or something of great importance this is the only time a phone should be allowed.

In conclusion, phones should not be allowed to be used while in a car. Text messages and phone calls themselves cause unnecessary to both civilians and to oneself.

"Phones & Driving

Cell phones were introduced in the United States market in the decade of 1980 and their usage instantly grew during the next two decades. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they are talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in a car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of an accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.",1
"Should people who are operating a automobile be able to use any technology while driving?

I believe that all phones should be put away while in an operating mobile. Most accidents are caused because of cellphone usage while driving. Mainly, because their attention is on other things, and it causes car insurance rates to rise. Besides that, protecting pedestrians and other motorists should be more important than a cell phone.

These days accidents are mostly caused by cell phones usage while operating a vehicle. Statistics show that one out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused from cell phone usage while driving (edgarsnyder. com). You can admit, it is hard to keep focus on the road when a phone is present. It is believed that phones shouldn't be in use while driving a vehicle. It is very dangerous for you and everyone else around you. There is always a chance of danger and with distraction from your phone there is a higher chance for an accident.

Secondly, when driving and using technology, usually your mind wonders off into another state. Driving with distractions from a noisey cellphone is kind of like driving under the influence of drugs. It's just too much going on at one time which could also cause an accident.

When the light turns greens and you're on your phone, what do you think happens? Traffic accidents. Or what about when you and someone else are waiting at a stop sign and you're busy on your cell phone and ""boom"" you hit them? There was a possibility you could have ended their life. That phone call or text message could've been responded to when you got to your destination. Am I right? Now a days, most people are afraid of traveling on the road because one they are afraid they may get hit, two they might hit someone, or three there's traffic somewhere. My mother won't even let me drive because she's hearing so many stories on how teens are losing their lives because of their cellphones. Would you want to let your child drive on a dangerous road knowing that there are people not paying attention to the road? No I don't think so.

Also, insurance rates are rising throughout the nation, so many accidents are around and typically they are because of a phone. There are many ways of causing an accident but ""Driver error is most often the result of ""distracted driving."" By far the most common cause of driver distraction is the use of cell phones"" according to Dr. Daniel Landers. But why is a phone more important than your safety? It shouldn't be. There are now many states in the United States with the ""hands free"" law to prevent people from using cellphones while operating the vehicle and so far, there have been less accidents involving phone usage.

In conclusion, laws have been enacted to protect all citizens from distracted drivers.

Specifically drivers who use their cellphones responsibly with hands free devices ensures that all citizens get to their destination safer than when these laws weren't in effect. As a result, drivers can expect decreased insurance costs in the future.",1
"Today, majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. There is a new law called ""hands free"" where people that own a cell phone cannot operate it while driving. This has effected people that own motor vehicles in many ways. People need their phones to direct their self's places or answer emergency texts or calls.

The new ""hands free"" law is a law where no one can hold their phone while driving. This has effected people with older cars and even newer cars to this day. As this law is in set, people have to connect their phone to Bluetooth to be able to talk on the phone. For example, if you're driving and someone calls, you have to have your phone connected to Bluetooth to be able to talk. In some cases this can be bad for the driver and other people driving on the road also. If your phone isn't connected to Bluetooth while you're driving, there can be a high risk of a crash when you're connecting your phone to Bluetooth. In some cases, there could also be an emergency call you have to answer, and people that don't have Bluetooth in their car can be effected by this law. The ""hands free"" law shouldn't be a law.

Although the government thinks the hands free law is going to help the risk of crashes, the hands free law could be much less safe than using your hands. ""Incredibly, they also spent less time watching the road, even when they were texting by voice."" Stated in the Text Free is No Safer to use while driving. The Texas A&M Transportation institute studied people driving a closed course under three conditions: while texting by hand, while texting by voice, and by not texting at all. It seems as if texting by voice should be safer than looking at your phone, but studies show that texting by voice and by looking at your phone, the reaction time is still the same.

The hands free law can affect you in a positive or negative way. Yes, talking on the phone while your driving is a dangerous distraction. ""Many studies have shown that the level of distraction has more to do with the intensity of the conversation"" Stated in the ""Total bans may be impractical"" debate. Studies show, an in depth conversation that requires a good deal of thought causes a higher level of distraction than a relatively short. The time and the length of the phone call is what is dangerous.

Even though the hands free law can help with the risk of car accidents and keep people off their phones while driving, studies have shown that wether your texting by voice or looking at your phone the risk of crashing is the same. The hands free law should not be in play.",1
"`As people separate from their phones, most people use their phones during driving. It is very important to talk and talk on the phone while driving. Using a mobile phone while driving can cause a fatal accident. There are several reasons why you need to ban phones during driving, such as sending a text message, making a phone call, using a mobile electronic device. There are many dangers when using mobile phones while driving.

You should not speak with your mobile phone while driving. You will be distracted by telephone conversation. This is similar to driving while you are drunk. If you talk on the phone while driving, the reaction may be delayed if accidental driving hazards occur. Or you will never feel danger until too late. More and more research shows the danger of distracting, and hands free phones do not seem to bring much improvement, if any. There are more incidents of speaking on the phone than text messages, but this may be due to the fact that the the phone is widely used (compared to text messages).

The problem with social issues today is the fact of text messaging an driving. When it comes to text messaging, you want to immediately notify you when you know your phone. It is very important to silence your phone while in safe driving. It affects only one person, and it also affects people around you. Because of the adverse impacts caused by many accidents, text messages and driving are illegal.",1
"Driving Distracted

Many drivers usually text and drive even if it's just to change a song. During this time one can easily become distracted from the road. This is how accidents occur and there are some who use their phone constantly and don't see a problem. Drivers should not be allowed to use their phones while driving.

When people are driving and receive a notification or a call on their phone the first thing they might do is check it. This can cause many problems as in that second that you are looking at your phone you can become easily distracted. This is how most accidents occur. Also when the driver begins to text and drive their focus is on what there texting instead of the road. In that time that you are looking at your phone you can hit a pothole or simply lose control of the vehicle endangering you and the other people on the road. There are also people who when they begin to text and drive they take their hands off the steering wheel. This is extremely dangerous because if the car begins to swerve you will have a delayed reaction and less time to react.

Laws have been implemented as to stop the use of phones while driving. In Georgia a law was implemented called the hands free which means while driving you may not use anything that may distract you. These laws have good intentions but many simply choose to ignore them. Even with these laws accidents still occur because of phones many just simply don't care. When people ignore these laws they need to be enforced better as many still text and drive. Even with laws in place many will text and drive and not care for others or themselves.

There are some uses for phones while driving but one should never text and drive. The main use for using a phone while driving is to use the gps. Using a gps does not require for you to be texting and driving if you set the destination beforehand. You can also simply put your phone in a do not the disturb so that you will not become distracted or turn your phone off. There are also apps to help you limit the use of texting and driving as you can make your phone not receive messages while you are driving.

Even with laws or apps many will still text and drive. This still causes many problems as you are not only endangering you but the people around you. Phones should only be used for directions while driving or not at all. Stricter laws should be imposed so people won't text and drive. Drivers should not be allowed to use their phones while driving.",1
"The Dangers of Texting and Driving

Technology has come a long way, making it near to irresistible, but that can come at a serious cost. Smartphones connect everyone to everything; other people, the news, the weather, GPS, and social media. Smartphone also connect to vehicles with being able to change music, take calls, and adjust GPS. These features sound great and helpful, but they can cost lives. A person who takes their eyes off the road to look at their phone are easily distracted from their surroundings. During their distractions they have high risks of injuring themselves and others. Texting and driving is dangerous to everyone.

Approximately one out of four car crashes in the United States is caused by texting and driving. In sixteen states, along with United States territories: Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, even holding your phone while driving in general is illegal. In nineteen states, holding while driving in the presence of children, in the case of bus drivers, is illegal as well. Just how dangerous is cell phone use while driving if it is banned in almost twenty states? According to the CDC, ""Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver."" (CDC.gov). Texting while driving can not only take your life, but an innocent bystanders'. Even though everyone knows these dangers, yet people still text and drive.

To understand why people still text and drive, there is context on just how much people use their phones every day. According to study by Dscout, the average person will touch their phones 2,617 times a day; they will spend around four hours in total every day going through their phone. With every alert and message the phone gives off, people are more likely to check it. Social media updates and a quick text message may seem like a safe way to use your cellular device while on the highway, but in reality those few seconds their eyes are down to their screens, can cause disaster. Phone use has been shown to be highly addictive and American cellular companies need to make phone easier to ignore while on the road.

In conclusion, texting and driving is harmful to everyone. The people who are injured or are killed, their friends, and their families alike. Ways to connect your phone to the car completely hands free needs to be taught to everyone. The unnecessary phone activity needs to diminish. Phones are highly addictive but they will never be as important as someone's life.",1
"IF DRIVERS SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE CELL PHONE WHY DRIVING

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, int ernet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of theset hings at the same t ime. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one t ime that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can' t put down our cell phones.

Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the drive r themselves for a couple of good reasons. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on t he road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phoneswhether they want to or not because of the hazards they creat e. Err atic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.

As scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consult ancy

BuzzM aven Labs, says "" [He] came wit hin inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of t ra ffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro (tailgating) the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestr ians.

Furthermore, there are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention.

They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating at the same time that increases threats to safety. Drivers has also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance.

Drivers demonstrates comparatively slower braking responses and also had low awareness of other traffic flowing through the roads ignoring their presence concentrating more on cell phones and less on roads as how other drivers are behaving. Different studies have reported hundreds of deaths during a year because of using cell phones during driving. It can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.",1
"CR Driving & Texting!

I strongly agree that phones should be banned while driving because of all the accidents they are causing. These are causing insurance to rise and causing scare to people's health. Studies have proven that drivers who use phones while driving are more responsible for the cause of an accident. Driving is dangerous technique and to safely execute driving you should be 100% focused, but if you are drunk or on your phone, you are potentially in danger to yourself and others on the road. As a society, we have become very less mindful of everything going on around us and do not take much precaution of things happening right in front of us.

Many people think distractions while driving is only texting and driving but in fact, while driving, sometimes it is easy to lose focus on the road because you are on the phone or because so much could be happening around you, but this means you forget you are on the road with others, instead of by yourself. Research has it, "" The available studies so far suggest that talking on the phone while driving, even hands-free, is as bad or worse than driving drunk. ... A test of 41 adults found that driving while intoxicated was actually less dangerous than driving while talking on a hand-held phone or a hands-free phone.""",1
"Should Drivers be allowed to use their phones?

Many people like to use their phone while driving for many reasons. Whether it's for changing the music or to yell at the GPS when you get lost. Sometimes there are emergency phone calls that make you feel like they can't wait. Especially with the growth of technology drivers are most likely to grab their cellphones. Many of these reasons are the main cause of car accidents that happen in today's world. With distractions from the road drivers are most likely to swerve into the other lane or crash into another. Therefore Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle for the safety of others and for themselves.

Due to a report of accidents that happened in 2018 about ""40,000 people lost their lives to car crashes"" and 4,637 of those people died in the crash due to cell phone usage. Texting and driving can cause about 5 times as many accidents as drunk driving. Technology has grown and so has the usage of cellphones. Nowadays people use their phone to locate the nearest coffee shop or to watch their shows, the thing is they watch it at the most inappropriate time. Instead of focusing on the road the driver puts all their attention towards the phone causing them to swerve into the other lane or hit another car that's slowing down on the highway. In the state of Georgia there was a bill that was passed known as the House Bill 673. This bill is also known as the `Hands Free Law ' ''. This law basically says that under no condition should the cellphone be in the driver's hand at any time. The consequence of this bill is a ""Fine of $50-$150 depending on the offence"" (Google). With this bill passed many more civilians will be able to not use their phone and be less likely to get into accidents because if the driver gets caught with it they will have to pay a fine and get a point on their license.

Texting and driving is not only risky but can put the driver and other drivers on the road lives on the line. Just because a driver can get away with texting and driving once doesn't mean it won't catch up to them one day. Based on a real event a teen killed a father and his 10 year old daughter after she ""ran a red light because she was allegedly texting"" (teensafe. com). The teen was sentenced to 4 year probation and had to do community service. Not only could the driver take one's life and be scarred but could also do damage to their family members. That is why there are clubs and teen meets that talk about the danger of texting and driving and most of the teachers have experience the horror themselves or had lost a loved one due to an event like the mother of a teen in washington who ""Died after she was allegedly distracted by an incoming text while driving"" (teensafe. com) the mother ""now helps teens understand the dangers and uses a video that recreates her daughters crash to illustrate the horror""

Therefore texting in driving in any state should not be allowed, in fact it should pass the ""hands Free Law"" in every law that should prohibit the driver from touching their phone or having any part of their body supporting the phone. Not only will this help the safety of the driver but will benefit the other drivers on the road. More teen clubs should be made in order to get the message out on the dangers of texting and driving in order to prevent accidents from distracted drivers. As technology grows, so will distractions.",1
"Phones and Driving

In today's society, people have and use cell phones. Cell phones have become an addiction. People can't seem to put them down. Some people feel that people should not use their phones while driving their cars. I feel this way too. Using cell phones while driving have negative consequences in two ways. One, cell phones distract the driver. Two, cell phones are unsafe.

To begin with, phones can easily distract the person who's driving the car. The reason is that when that person is driving his car and when a notification ringer goes off, the driver would rush to his phone to see what came up. When this happens, he would then lose focus on the road and might kill someone. Whenever someone is driving his car he needs to focus on the road at all times. Distract driving is one of the main reasons why there's more car accidents in this country, especially Georgia. When the government starts enforcing no phones while driving, this will help end distractive driving and less car accidents would happen in cities and on the highway. Cell phones distracting the drivers is one of the main points why people should not use their phones while driving a car.

Next, drivers who use their phones while driving can be unsafe for the driver and other people who are around them. The reason is that when drivers are driving, they need to check their surroundings to make sure they do not hit someone or something. In the case of using a phone while driving can cause many deaths from getting run over/ hit from the car or from a car crash. This is really important that people need to be aware of what they're doing because if they make one mistake, it can cause a lot of lives. Safety is really important when it comes to using a phone because people can save lives if they put the phone down and focus on the road so that everyone can create a safer environment for people who want to drive their car. Most deaths are caused by car accidents due to using the phone while driving because people do not think about being safe not only for themselves but also the passengers who are in the car with them. Safety is one thing people need to take a stand on, because drivers need to realize that if they do not put the phone down, then it could create more deaths and less safety in the area.

In conclusion, drivers who use their phone while in the process of driving can end in an unsafe situation not only for themselves, but everyone that is around them. Distracting driving and safety are the two reasons why people should not use their phones while in the process of driving. Phones can easily take away the focus on the road because it leads to bad outcomes in the end.",1
"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

Drivers are at a four time greater risk of causing an accident when driving and texting. While using their cell phones drivers lose sight of the task at hand and stop paying attention to what they are doing. According to the ""National Safety Council"" ""Cell phones used while operating a motor vehicle leads to 1.6 million crashes a year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from distracted driving by cell phone usage."" Not many take driving seriously until you consider how many people die each day and how many in a year due to a fatal car crash. Well According to ""Teen Safety"" ""Over 3,287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash.""

Distracted driving whether it be from cell phone usage, eating, drinking, operating a radio, or even being lost in thought, it can lead to injuries or even death. When a vehicle is moving at the speed of 35 to 45 mph, Depending on the age of the drivers and passengers in both cars determines the fatality or how sever the injuries are in an accident.

When drivers are trying to text and drive at the same time they are not thinking about how their actions can affect those around them. Drivers are not thinking about how they are putting someone else's life at risk or in danger when they are distracted driving from improper cell phone usage. Drivers are not considering that from the actions they are taking by using their cell phones that someone could lose their life or end up in the hospital with very severe injuries. Drivers who cannot wait to use their phone until the vehicle has come to a complete stop meaning that the vehicle is completely off are being really selfish and inconsiderable of those around them.

So in conclusion drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle because it is not safe for them or those around them and it can and will affect someone's life whether it's the driver who is using their cell phones to the people in the opposite car that they have had an accident with even down to the passengers in the same vehicle.",1
"Phones and Cars

Many habitants of planet earth have and use their cellular device as second nature. Cellphones, while useful in the sense of communication, entertainment, and business transactions, can be dangerous tools of distraction behind the wheel. An example of this would be the statistics based on vehicular manslaughter and other effects of the car accidents that are recorded each year. Tens of thousands of Americans are victims of car accidents every year with the distraction of cellphones being the lead cause for fender benders every year. Governments officials and representatives are faced with the same issue and must constantly find a solution to the issue of cellphone use behind the wheel. The main question being whether cell phone use should be allowed at all while operation heavy machinery.

That being said, it would be for the better of humanity if cellphones be allowed only when at a complete stop with the vehicle in park. The reason why the allowance would be more beneficial than the stripping of the whole ability is because of the instinctual nature of humans to do what seems good even if it is forbidden. This can be seen in the Book of Genesis, where Eve chooses the forbidden fruit over every other fruit in the garden, due to the thought that she would never be able to taste that specific fruit if she were to obey God's orders. This shows the weakness in man, that, even if he or she should be shunned, smitten, banished, or punished in any way by the highest power, man shall carry out the forbidden just to have a form of secret liberty.

This liberty would remain in the citizens' mindsets if they had the ability of freedom that would be disguised by regulations. The perception of a freedom is a more effective way to regulate the general population that the prohibition of the acts that are the root of a problem, such as the case of the dangers of texting and driving. The first regulation would include the full stop of a vehicle, ensuring that the driver is not endangering the lives of everybody else when they need their phone. The second part of the new rule would call for the mandatory parking of the car, so that the car has no potential to endanger the other lives on the road. These rules would send the message that the nation needs to stay focused on the task of driving and should refrain from getting distracted by phone use.

The task of driving is a boring task, thus the temptation of using a device to make the job of travel less monotonous becomes more alluring to the driver. Therefore, the use of cell phones should still be partially allowed for those who ride the road every day. To ask for the privilege be taken all together would cause uproar and rebellion, but to give that chance to change a song on the phone, or to reroute the GPS software on the phones leaves a margin of freedom for the civilians who are forced to follow the policy. Without those exact laws, every nation will continue to face accidents and become yet another percentage on the yearly submission of the quota for accidents and deaths caused using cell phones.

Overall, to avoid becoming a statistic in the list of deaths, it would behoove the general populations to insert these regulations into their driving lives. This would promote a safer environment for travel and would reduce the number of driving hazards and obstacles by a grand percentage. All it takes to keep oneself safe and others safe is the awareness and comprehension of the activity on the road, rather than the activity on a phone.",1
"Phones can be the best thing in our day and age because technology changing. everyday people die in a car accident because they were distracted by their cell phones while driving. People use their phones while driving to keep in touch with some people when it can wait. Even connecting your phone to your car for hands free its still dangerous because your more into texting or snapping someone back when it can wait. If its an emergency you should pull over and put your car in park and do what you need to do instead of endangering yourself or other drivers on the road with you.

Many people say that hands free set is a safety because you have 2 hands on the wheel instead of one on your phone and the other on the wheel. But however i think its still not safe because you would be more into texting or calling someone instead of driving. People have been immune to their phones that they gotta be on their phone every second even while driving. Its not just young drivers its older experienced drivers too.

Many more people say its not safe to drive while with your phone because your endangering your life and other drivers. The leading causes of death in a car accidents are drunk drivers or distracted drivers. Now a days you cant just drive your car you gotta look around your surrounding for an example cars swerving in your lane while on their phone. What would you do? Speed up or slow down or stay riding next to them. You have to be on your p's and q's while driving because you have inexperienced drivers and experts. What ever is on your phone could wait because its not going away instead of risking your life while driving.

In conclusion, don't use your phone or operate your phone while driving because it can lead to many more problems than texting back""ok"". You don't want to end up in the hospital thinking why did i do that i should've waited. Your not going to think about that while driving. Obvious the person your texting don't care about you if they texting you while your driving. If people don't put their phones to the side its going to be more deaths in car accidents. They shouldn't endanger many other people lives for a simple text or something. Don't think about just your self, think about other lives on the road with you. You also have to watch out for other drivers too.",1

People should not use their phones while driving because it is a huge safety hazard with many deadly consequences. Another reason, it puts the people that don't have car insurance at risk as well. People in America fall to realize the amount of damage they do when doing something so dangerous to ourselves and to other people. People who don't care about their own lives would do an action like this.

It's basically a safety hazard when it comes don't to situations like this. For example in 2019 there were over 55,000 accidents over the country every day and it's because a person is on his or her phone. Events like this puts people in America in panic, especially new drivers. Also another fact actions like this as increases the death rate in America which makes the country look bad. Then it also uses a lot of our resources to repair the damage to the car or for the factory to make more cars.

Car accidents are expensive to not just the people but also to their car insurance. Being in a car accident can affect your money which isn't a good if you're the type of person that having a hard time in life. People don't think about the consequences just by texting and driving. That person that caused the accident just by taking his eyes off the road could take a life or ruin someone's life. I believe that people don't need phones while their driving unless it's being used for good reason, like for example the GPS. Anything else shouldn't be allowed to protect the people and keep our taxes from going up because of these rates.",1
"Phones and Driving

In this day in age you can see the amount of people using their phones and driving has rised. The idea of using a cellphone while the vehicle is being operated should not occur due to risking the lives of people inside the vehicle or outside. Although using a phone for an emergency is different. There are many ways on how to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Laws have been passed to prevent horrible things happening to people while texting and driving.

Phones and Driving would never go along with each other, it's a bad idea. In doing so half of the time a driver would use their cell phone to use social media or something that is not important and can be done on their spare time. Many accidents have happened before the world's countries have put up laws to regulate the use of a cell phone while driving. It's a huge distraction back then not many accidents occurred but many fatalities did. I believe that it is very useful to use a cellphone to navigate but there's a way in doing so.

Emergencies can occur at any moment and anytime without knowing when it will happen we can't control that. Even though tragic things can happen it is best to stay off your phone to avoid causing major or tragic problems. A simple glimpse at your phone can make you lose control of the wheel anything can happen. It is better to pull over if necessary to stay safe and keep those around you safe as well.

Countries and states around the world have this as a problem of people getting distracted easily by a phone. It has been a hard process to regulate this till this day people have caused many harm. Although tickets and warnings don't really help the situation but it does stop some people. Getting punished for putting lives is not fair, nobody would want to die due to a distraction.

In conclusion driving and using a cell phone is not a good idea no matter the situation. Staying safe on the road is very important a little distraction is not worth crashing or a ticket or even putting others at risk. This is why I think no one should be able to operate a vehicle and use a phone there are many ways to talk on the phone with bluetooth a text message can always wait. Keep in mind that technology has a place and time to use. It shouldn't be taken as a careless manner while driving because it has caused many problems on the road.",1
"Phones and driving

Have you ever seen someone on their phone while driving and not paying any attention? It's becoming more common to see drives on the road and using their cell phones. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time , they have become a key part of our lives now. People today use their phones to check up on social media, the latest news reports and also to stay in touch with loved ones. We should not be able to use phones while driving because not only is it against the law it also causes people to get easily distracted and lose focus on the road ahead.

One reason why individuals should not use phones while driving is because it can cause the lack of focus to the driver. Sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone. Not having both hands on the wheel and your eyes focused on your phone can cause a huge accident. Not only can you hurt yourself in an accident you can also hurt other individuals in other vehicles and also passengers in the car with you. For example your phone rings and you get a notification. Why reaching for your phone you can fail to notice major activities happening on the road.

Another reason why phones should not be used while driving. Because driving and on the phone is against the law. According to state law "" Drivers may listen to streaming music that does not include videos on the screen of their phone or device while driving but cannot touch their phones while on the road to activate or program any music streaming app.

Streaming music that is controlled by and listened through the vehicle's radio is allowed.

Drivers who need to touch their phones to activate/program their music streaming apps must do so before getting on the road"" (""Hands-Free Law"") .

Which gives people a clear understanding on what the rules and regulations and the right from wrong are about using phones while driving.

In conclusion phones should not be used while driving. It is a distraction and can hurt others around. You can get in on accident and it can affect your whole life forever. And also using your phone while driving is against the law. Even if you want to check your phone at a stop light still don't. Now the only way you can possibly answer the phone is for emergencies only and the phone must be on speaker so you can still pay attention to the road ahead.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Responsibility of Texting and Driving

Cell phones are everywhere! Everyone has a phone or some type of electronic device. These devices are very useful, but they can also be a distraction. Driving is a freedom that many people look forward to obtaining in their lives, but it is also a major responsibility. Some things go together, like peanut butter and jelly, but cellphones and driving are not a good match.

Driving and texting is one of the number one causes of traffic accidents.

Drivers should not be able to utilize their cell phone at any time while operating a vehicle because it distracts them from the road and decreases their awareness.

Cell phones can be useful while driving, but they can lead to distractions. Many people use cell phones to get directions when they are lost or stream music.

The apps that are used to give directions and to listen to music are great, but the notifications from other social media apps can be a major distraction. According to the NY Post, ""Americans check their phone on average once every 12 minutes - burying their heads in their phones 80 times a day"" (NYP).

This study was done in 2017.

People check their phones more now than they did back in 2017 because there are more apps that people can download on their phones.

If phones were just used for giving directions or listening to music while driving, it would be okay, but everyone does not think to turn off their notifications so their phones become a major distraction. Therefore, it is a safer option to just not use the phone at all while driving.

Not only are phones a major distraction, they decrease awareness and slow a person's reaction.

When a person is driving, they have to pay attention to their surroundings and quickly respond when other drivers drive recklessly. If someone is on their phone, their awareness is decreased and they do not respond as quickly as they would if they did not have their phone in their hand.

The only thing that drivers should be focused on is the steering wheel and road.

In the end, using a phone while driving can cause accidents because it is a major distraction and it decreases awareness. When people use their phones and drive, they are putting their life and the lives of other people at risk. Even the most aware drive can get distracted by their phone. Using the phone for just a few seconds while driving can result in a major accident that could kill multiple people. The safest option for everyone is to simply stop, park, and use the phone.",1
"Phones, Cars

Should people have the privilege and/or the right to be able to have their phone out inside the car? While there are some good reasons why you should have the right, there are some things that people just can't help.

We already can't stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and now a days more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people don't even realize that there even doing it and most care now a days have the Bluetooth or people sell Bluetooth devices so you can be on call and drive while you drive making it better for the people but as tested on ""MythBusters"" changes a little but still distracts you in some sort of way people also know there way around things already and sometimes work or no most of the times it works but some of the times it doesn't under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or ""fine print"" and they can just say oh well it's like a Bluetooth but it wasn't type of stuff and the court can't do anything about it.

This is what I think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally I don't care what they do or say all I care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or not.

They (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can't lie, or anything even know they shouldn't even if it's an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn't do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car.

This is what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.",1
"A Position on Vehicles and Cell Phones

Over the last several years, mounting evidence has suggested that paying any sort of attention to a cell phone while operating a vehicle can have disastrous consequences. However, people continue to overestimate what they are capable of, at the expense of themselves and others. What the scientific community has concluded is that the bottom line for why accidents happen is distraction. This comes in the form of anything that requires you to pay attention to things other than the road, such as a text message. Cell use may not have to be prohibited while in a vehicle per se, but certainly while operating one on an open road.

The largest study ever conducted on texting while driving likely also offers the best data.

This study is of course the one done by Zendrive, which analyzed the driving behavior of 3.1 million Americans. What this study found is that, of the people that drive, 88% use their cell phone in some capacity. What's more, this in spite of rigorous campaigns railing against distracted driving. Given the slight changes between two generations of drivers, we can assume it will take some time to get the habit worn away from most members of our society. This said, it's unlikely that legislating harder restrictions will change the amount of people who text and drive to an observably good degree. The biggest changes happen culturally, and slowly.

The dangers of texting while driving rival the dangers of drinking while driving. Several studies have shown in driving simulations that being distracted by a text can be as dangerous as operating a vehicle while intoxicated. A quarter of adults report that texting while driving doesn't hinder their driving performance. Any form of activity that takes attention away from the task is a costly chance.

Multitasking is the real killer here. People aren't good at it; it's asking too much of the brain. Humans are really good at focusing on one activity at a time, and anything more than that dramatically decreases proficiency. One study from the Scientific American shows that confident multitaskers are more prone to mistakes than their non confident counterparts.

None of this is to say that there is never a time to use a cell phone while in a car. Just, never while driving. It's a risk with little to no reward, but given the amount of people already doing it, knowing it's a mistake, it's unlikely that legislating against it will bring about the cultural shift required to make good changes. What we can do, though, is encourage safer practices for cell phone use in vehicles. Like pulling over to make phone calls or texts.

"Using your phone while driving is dangerous. People should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it is a hazard. People can die in car wrecks because they were on their phones while driving. People can get paralyzed by these car wrecks because of a cellphone. It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

Your main concern while your driving is that you obey the law and don't get in any wrecks. Your cellphone should not be your main concern while you are driving because it causes wrecks because your not paying attition to the road. Most wreck are because of people on their cellphones. About 421,000 people are injured in wrecks caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving are the number one reason for wrecks in the US.

Texting and driving has its pros and cons. One pro is that you could get a text about an emergency and you could possibly save someones life. Another pro is that if your lost then you can look up where you have to go or get directions. Some of the cons are that you can get in wrecks, get injured, and even die because you were texting and driving. You should be able to be on your phone is there is bad traffic or if your at a red light.

Having your phone out while your driving is illegal now because of the risks of doing so. You cant even eat or drink while driving because of the hazards. Texting and driving is no joke. It is the number one cause for wrecks in the world and it can also take your life. I think that texting and driving should be illegal because if your lost or have to text somebody you can always pull over to the side of the road and use your phone because you can put not only your life at risk, but everyone else that is in the car as well.",1
"Phones and Driving

Phones have become such an integral part of today's society in such a small amount of times. To the point where it is now considered surprising to not have one of these handheld devices. People are able to contact their family from miles away, check up on the weather, and even entertain themselves on their by watching videos or playing games. However, it isn't all good. Phones become entertaining to the point of distraction. Most of the world having to come up with new rules and laws for these devices and anything like them. 26% of the population getting into car accidents from being distracted by their phones from texting ('How Many Car Accidents Are Caused by Cellphones?' by Bay and Associates). Question is, should drivers be able to use their phones while driving in any capacity? Especially with the rise of their popularity and use with each generation?

Phones should be continued to be used by drivers in most capacities. Not everything should be allowed to continue or be taken off of the law, like the use of any social media or texting for example, because a phone has more uses than that. Texting if obviously the main thing we blame car accidents on, but sometimes it's more than that. Social media platforms can lead to distractions as well. Snapchat, a picture/video media platform led to a girl taking a photo in her car only to crash not even 20 minutes later back in April 2019 ('Teen who drove 106mph, used Snapchat in crash that killed friend is going to prison.' by Noah Feit). While things like that are horrible they shouldn't be banned completely while driving. If someone gets lost on their road they can always use google maps to get back home to said person's families. Maybe a family member or close friend is having an emergency, medical or otherwise, and tries to call up that person but they can't say anything due to their phone being banned. Leaving the Family member/friend to be alone or call someone else.

There is also the fact that not all car accidents are caused by texting and driving. Yes. It is a leading cause, but there are plenty of other causes of car accidents ('Top 15 Causes Of Car Accidents And How You Can Prevent Them.' by Elizabeth Laiza King). There are the causes that is more human error. There is distracted driving, drinking and driving, speeding, running a red light, etc. Then there are the more natural causes that could happen to even the most innocent, careful and law abiding citizens. Rain and potholes being a good couple of them. Just imagine driving in the rain at night and up the street is a pothole that you can barely make out. Oh, but there could be a solution to these problems to reduce car crashes! Ban all of them. A good idea on paper, but impossible to do and succeed without any car accidents ever again. Obviously you can't ban rain from open roads, and car accidents caused by drinking happens more often than not.

Alcoholic influence and texting are two very different things. Both should be banned from driving, but banning your phone completely when driving is similar to banning a couple of bottles in the back of the car and getting in trouble for that. Even though you aren't touching them or plan on using it for later use outside of the car. The percentage of car accidents while drinking and driving being 28% ('Motor Vehicle Safety' by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Meanwhile texting and driving being only 26%. A 2% difference. Still both very dangerous things. Yet drinking and driving still isn't banned completely. Yes, it's against the law, but you are allowed to drive after a couple of drinks as long as your Blood Alcohol Concentration stays at 0.08 at the maximum ('Alcohol & Drug Info: What is BAC?' by Stanford University: Office of Alcohol Policy and Education).

Phones as an entirety shouldn't be completely banned as long as alcohol isn't completely banned. Texting/messaging while driving should still be a concern, and shouldn't be reconsidered at all, but not everything is bad on a phone while driving. Coming into this new generation of drivers, it would be a good idea to start coming up with ways to possibly integrate these devices into driving tactics or the car itself. This way, it's possible to still get a use of a phone as well as lowering the car crash rate worldwide. Many cars coming up with this type of hands free technology. Jeep being a good example of this.",1
"Electronic devices nowadays are in everyone's pockets, everyone has one, even kids.

In these times, it is essential to have one, even poor people can have an electronic device. With that being said they are always in people's faces everywhere you go, when we're walking, shopping, even when people are working they have their phones out, but if your job requires this it's ok. People always tend to be distracted by their devices which leads to them blindly making mistakes that could have easily been avoided if their head wasn't stuck in a phone. With that being said, the question for today is, should phones be allowed while driving in an automobile.

I personally don't think that phones should be allowed while driving unless you have your phone propped up in your car, and you're using it for directions, therefore you're in a place of need for your device. Otherwise i don't think you should be recklessly texting and driving because that doesn't only put you and your passengers in danger of crashing but also everyone else on the road around you. These types of fatal accidents always happen, because people think they can be aware enough to be on their phone and drive. An estimated amount of about 391,000 people were injured in texting and driving related crashes in 2017. This goes to show that you should always be careful because I am pretty sure everyone of those 300 thousand people didn't plan on getting into an accident before it happened.

Texting and driving is dangerous, it kills hundreds of people every year, especially since there are new drivers every year. Teen drivers are usually the ones who text and drive the most, which is another reason why teen crashes are at an alltime high. That doesn't mean adults don't do it, I personally know someone who was always on their phone when they were driving.

Texting, talking, or just catching up on social media, which is so irrelevant while you are driving. This person didn't learn until they crashed their car by rear ending a truck, and can you guess why this incident happened? It was because she was talking on her phone while it happened.

Being on your phone and driving can be avoided with all the technology we are starting to have now. Now we have tools that can hold your phone in a visible position without distracting your view from the road, And you don't have to hold it. Modern vehicles are also being made with built in screens which is like it's own phone in the car, which you can operate while parked, and some features while you are driving. Society is constantly upgrading so that incidents like these can stop happening so much, because they are so preventful. We as a society are starting to put our phones down, especially because if you are seen by a police officer with a phone in your hand while you're driving you can instantly get pulled over and get a ticket.

As a driver myself I try not to use my phone while I'm moving, I personally try to wait until I'm stopped at a red light or I stop at a stop sign. If I need directions I can put the computer in my car and it'll take me to my destination the same as my phone would. If I want to send a text, I can either use Siri or just call the person and use a handsfree call. We as a society need to learn how to work around the dangers when it comes to things like this that can put our lives in danger, and random innocent people in danger also. Because if we don't preventable tragedies like these will never end.",1
"Cell phones have become very popular. Almost everyone who is old enough to drive owns a cell phone. They have become a part of life. Cell phones are an asset this day and time, but they can also be very dangerous. Although cell phones are a necessity, I do not think they should be used while driving.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. You shouldn't be on your phone while driving. It causes all types of tragic deaths. The best way to stop it is to enforce the no use law. People die almost every day from this. When you drive and text it causes accidents and deaths. People have a hard time with texting and driving. They just have to pick up the phone that instant. To me, I fill like electronics are evil to humans because since they dropped the first phone the death rates has increase.

Using your phone and driving is just like drinking and driving. I saw my mother actually texting and driving and she slam on brakes. It was very scary at the moment because we were young. People just love to do that. I'm not going to lie if the phone call is important to me, I am going to answer it, but I will try to pull off of the road first. I do not want to cause an accident and hurt myself or someone else just to answer a call or text. That can wait.

Using cell phones while driving put everyone's life in danger. We don't know what the person behind the wheel is going through. There is nothing so important it can't wait. Next time you get that phone call or text while driving, wait until you stop the car to answer it. You could save your life or the life of someone else.",1
"Phones and Driving

Cell phones and cars are not a good mix and people should never try and use both at the same time. Using both phone and car at the same time can cause a major accident and can cause people to get hurt because someone wanted to use their phone while they drove their car. When you use your phone while driving you are putting more than yourself at risk of losing your life you also endanger the person you crash into and whoever you or they have in the car. When these two items mix it is no good for anybody especially the ones on the street.

The world is a very exciting place and there is so much to do and can even do multiple things at once, but somethings shouldn't be done while another is happening. Being on your phone while driving is one of the many things you shouldn't do it causes accidents that will leave someone badly damaged or without their life. When someone loses their life their family will grieve and you shouldn't want to be the cause of their or your family's grief so you should take precautions that you stay out of situations that could put you in the wrong spotlight.

On average 11 teens die a day from texting and driving. These are people who just wanted to see what their friends had to say or what's trending on instagram. As sad as it is, these people didn't take good precautions before they took off in the car, they just wanted to arrive at the location they were headed too. They didn't think that they were going to lose their life from texting and driving. People should learn from others' mistakes and shouldn't text and drive knowing it is dangerous.

There are over 2.35 million people in the United States today that are injured or disabled due to a car crash, and there are more than 330,000 of those accidents due to Texting and driving. When a person text while driving there is never a good outcome of them doing that a young teen or an older person or there self ends up getting hurt in the process. The generation today's technology has drastically increased. People are so reliant on the use of their phones and more things. Nowadays a lot of people don't even like to have a phone conversation simply because they can send it through a text. The conclusion of all the car wrecks the accident is mostly caused by a person wanting to text while driving .

The purpose of this essay is to give you some information on why you shouldn't text and drive at the same times. People always think they have to immediately have to respond to a text this is why many of the accidents occur. The ages that always cause accidents are the teens the ages from 17 and up they always act like soon as they hear that ding they have to check their phone. Don't text and drive text there is never a good outcome of that, think about your life and others. Text and drive doesn't mix you need your eyes on the road you can not text and drive, don't even think about picking your phone up. If you even think about picking your phone up just pause and think about how many lives you will be putting at risk by picking up your phone.

"""Distracted Driving is a No-Go""

In a recent Google search, it was estimated that about ""1.2 billion people drive in the world"". Imagine if every driver had a cell phone, and used it while driving, this would cause a lot of distractions and possible deadly accidents. It is my belief that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Today's generation is really the most tech savvy because now people trying to use their phone while driving and it is very dangerous. Teens are very distracted by their phone and when they get a call or text they try to pick it up while driving that's why people need hand free Bluetooth in their car. According to Esurance, ""cognitive or mental distraction is when a driver's mind isn't focused on driving. Talking to another passenger or being preoccupied with personal, family, or work-related issues are some examples."" Teens would rather make snapchat videos then driving. While you drive put your phone on do not disturb while you drive or you put on their manual so it knows that you driving.

Secondly, you can also can get in a deadly accident while trying to text and drive. According to an Usa Today article,"" In Houston, the driver of a pickup truck that collided with a church minibus in rural Texas, killing 13 people, apologized after the crash and acknowledged he had been texting while driving."" People don't know how dangerous it is for you text and drive, until it's too late.

In a recent google search, it has been ""1.6 billon crashes each year by texting and driving"". Those are scary numbers!

Although, they made a new law that people in Georgia can't have their phones in their hands while driving. According to Alive, ""Georgia's hands-free law took effect on Sunday, July 1, 2018. It is a sweeping, landmark measure that has been under consideration for several years and will affect all of us as Georgians in one way or another."" People can't send or watch a video while driving. The hand free law is all over Georgia and they trying to spread it around the world so people hold their phone at all. Even though the law is in place, I see on a daily, drivers still using their phones.

In the end, people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it is not safe for people around the world. The law keeps the people safe and it is up to us to enforce and follow the laws to keep all drivers and passengers safe on the road.",1
"Phones are equipped by everyone in today's society. Whether you are poor or rich or even in between, getting a phone seems to be the easiest thing to get your hands on. Humans use phones to keep in contact originally but now it's used for entertainment, and nowadays you can make a lot of money off of your cellular device. However people tend to use phones more often than they should now since there have been more social apps, texting etc. equipped on devices. One big issue in the overuse of phones is using them while operating a vehicle. This particularly is a big issue because people have gotten hit, and many accidents have been the result of using phones while in the car. Each year over 421,000 accidents happen every year due to texting and driving or the driver was distracted by something else on their phone as well. Driving while using your phone can be very detrimental to your life and someone else's.

Driving is risky every time you do it, there are a lot of bad drivers out there just as much as there are good drivers out there so it is always important to be focused while you're on the road. Using a phone can be dangerous firstly because you can harm yourself or someone else as a result of not being aware while you're driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2017 there were 34,439 crashes and 9% of the crashes involved a distracted driver and 486 fatalities were as a result of these crashes with a cell phone in use. Also reports from the National Safety Council also say that if you are on your phone while you're driving then you are 6 times more likely to get into an accident then a drunk driver. These situations can affect both you and somebody else if you hit another car or just somebody crossing the street.

Nobody wants to go to court or be present in a court of law, especially for something like being on your phone while driving. Being on your phone while driving is a moving traffic violation and may go down as a criminal misdemeanor. Also depending on what state you're in you can pay fines for being on your phone while driving. For example in Georgia you pay $150 for being on your phone while driving but in other states such as California with the smallest fee you'd have to pay with only $20, however in Alaska with the highest fee you'd have to pay up to $10,000 and you'd have to do a year in prison as well. This can also go on your record if the state you live in has phone use while driving as a Moving traffic Violation. For this to be the repercussions of using your phone while driving, I'm telling you it's not worth it.

Finally Texting and Driving can also lead you to Prison. In the previous paragraphs I spoke on the fines and fatality statistics. In Alaska you can pay an additional $10,000 with a year in prison included and there were 486 fatalities in 2017 alone. Whether your texting or on social media while driving these distractions can end up hurting someone else more then you and this can lead you to the penitentiary even if it was an accident. In 2015 nearly 4,000 deaths occured due to distracted drivers another 3,450 were in the year 2016. This is a serious crime and people who have hit and killed people because they were distracted drivers can face up to 20 years in prison due to casualties from them being distracted. To play it safe the phone shouldn't be used while driving so no one gets hurt.

In Conclusion, being on your phone while driving is very dangerous for both you and people around you. This can be very detrimental to your record and you could be charged huge fines depending on where you live, you're not going to see many people in Alaska doing this. These accidents and casualties are preventable if drivers have the self control to only use their phones when there not driving their car. However maybe another way to fix it is if everyone had to pay the $10,000 like in Alaska, that may seem like a lot but someone loosing their life is worth way more.",1
"Accidents occur more often than we think, especially while driving.

Just think, accidents can happen in the blink of an eye.

There are hundreds of different ways for accidents to occur while driving but I want to focus on texting while driving.

Let's just keep it real, it is difficult to drive and access a phone at the same time, at least that is some multi-tasking skills that no one should try to master.

In this essay, I will be discussing three reasons why texting is not appropriate while driving: distractions, swerving, and all reasons could lead to a potential crash.

Texting while driving becomes an obstruction to other drivers when you are at a stop sign or red light, you are literally watching a phone while others are waiting for you to proceed.

This can lead to people yelling and honking horns just get your attention.

It is just right to respect the fact that there are others on the road, just maybe they want to proceed forth without unnecessary setbacks.

It is safe to try to focus on the road or signs at all times, after all safety should be the main concern for any driver.

Next, there is also the fact that you can easily swerve lanes.

Swerving lanes can be life-threatening.

If you swerve lanes, you can cause several accidents at one time.

I have actually had an experience with something like this.

My mom was texting, when all of a sudden the car began to shift across to the lane, we wound up causing several accidents.

Last but not least, there could be a potential crash.

Obviously, the main reason for not texting while driving is crashing.

I am almost positive that there is some high percentage of crashes caused by text.

I don't have evidence, but it is kind of common sense.

I mean it is difficult to look down at a phone and try to drive at the same time, ""it's an accident waiting to happen"" so to speak.

In conclusion, the real reason not to text and drive is because you can crash and die.

There is no need to sugarcoat the obvious because the end results can end in death.

I try not to text while I am driving because I just started driving and my skills are limited.

I would hate to crash into an innocent person.

Let's all practice being more careful when driving.",1
"Cell phone use and driving has been a highly discussed topic in the past ten years. While cell phone use is almost unanimous, the danger of being distracted while driving has lead many states to ban the use of hand held cell phones while in the car. Passing laws that require hands free devices such as blue tooth to keep your attention on the road. While it is not a guarantee that this is totally safe it lowers the risk of loosing focus while driving. This is due to how our brain codes information and how we attend to certain stimuli. While driving we are taking in constant visual stimuli, for example when you are driving you see a red light and stop. While driving mmight become slightly autonomous over time, attentive and working memory resources are being used to watch the road. While you are physically looking at your phone when texting, you are also using mental resources to decode and sort what you are seeing. This means that even when you look up you could still be distracted from the road because your attentional resources are being split up between the phone and driving. Contrary to common belief there is no such thing as ""multitasking"". The brain cannot preform two tasks at the same time; it however switches between each task. Cell Phone Use and Driving: A Deadly Combination In the world today, society suffers from cell phone addiction. People everywhere use some sort of mobile device constantly. This addiction on its own, while still negative, becomes especially dangerous when combined with driving. While driving, cell phones create many distractions. Some of these distractions include: dialing on the phone, answering the phone, simply talking on the phone, and texting. These distractions constantly increase with all of the new technology available today. The smart phones in every adult and teenagers ' pockets prove deadly when used on the road. According to a government website, ""In 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver"" (Distracted Driving). Although various disturbances exist while driving, cell phone usage has proved a fatal but preventable distraction.",1
"Phone and Driving Essay

Drivers should not text and drive because it can lead to various life threatening situations.

According to research, it shows that we should not text and drive because texting and driving can cause a lot of distraction, such as car accidents, running someone over, running a red light and a lot more bad accidents. Many people had lost their lives while texting and driving, especially teenagers because they are young, careless and reckless and also easily distracted. Texting while driving can lead to a lot of nasty death, according to an article I read online a few years back reminded me that texting while driving can cause a lot of damages, such as life threatening damages, harm to public safety, getting a ticket, and even crashing and killing yourself, this is why most states around the US came up with a new law that can get you arrested or given a ticket for texting and driving. Although this law has been passed a lot of people still text and drive which is not good for the public safety. For example

Including kids has been killed by reckless drivers and some of those drivers usually get away without any injuries or jail time and this is not fair to the victims families. Before you think about grabbing a phone to text and drive you should think about the victims family and you should also think about your own life, because you only have one life to live so you think twice before you put yourself in a place or position that will harm yourself.

(Theme) Do not text and drive.",1
"Phones & Driving

Should humans be allowed to use their cellar device while driving a truly age old question. People should be able to use their phone only if they have a car mount and are trying to use the GPS in my opinion. Otherwise pull to the side of the road if you just have to send a call or text. I truly don't understand what is that indispensable that you have to risk not only your life but others lives by picking up your phone. Just pull in to your local fast food or store and send that text that will (I assume) complete your life.

You know people have got seriously injured doing it ........

It's crazy the number of people that have died by texting and driving. Just in 2013 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Even more telling The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. (1.6!!)

Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. 74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. These are few stats that support my thesis but the stories hit closer to home for me the story of seven year old Xzavier is particularly disturbing A driver who allegedly was texting behind the wheel hit seven-year-old Xzavier Davis-Bilbo, dragging him nearly 20 feet in the process. The crash paralyzed Xzavier, and he spent four and a half months in the intensive care unit.

He won't ever walk again. That young man was only seven nowhere close to the prime years of his life. Know he can't play sports, run to the bus stop, or even jump up for a high-five because somebody was ""allegedly"" distracted by their phone.

But I can keep control i'm not them If it's one thing I know I know that people always think they can do something until they are proven wrong. Don't be that person this isn't a game this is literally life or death. Just because you haven't hit anyone yet doesn't mean your a celestial being at driving you have just been lucky. Other counter arguments might say but what I just need to do one little thing for work or school. Myself a guilty procrastinator (this is why I am making up this class) understand this argument but just be late for work or school and do it at home. Think about it what's worse killing someone by not paying attention or being late for work/school.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion t's now illegal to hold your phone while driving in the state of Georgia, part of a sweeping hands-free law that went into effect Sunday. Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rules even tapping ""play"" on a Apple playlist while not parked face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second time getting caught. The law, signed by Gov. Nathan Deal in May, aims to curtail driving fatalities in the state. So even if you believe a astounding driver you'll go to jail so just pull over.

"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones when operating and driving a car. There are many risks that come with using a cell phone when trying to operate a vehicle. Many accidents have been reported due to this. Using a phone while driving is dangerous and a huge risk.

The road requires your full-undivided attention. When using your phone while driving you then decrease the amount of attention you give to the road and your attention then is put into the phone. Drivers can sometimes get sidetracked and loose focus on the road when using a phone. It is easy to for an accident to happen. According to Teen Driver Source , ""Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving"". This proves that the attention span is removed from the road onto one's phone.

The road is a very busy place where a lot happens and if you don't make the right move, it can end up very badly. Not everyone can handle being able to divide their attention within the road and their phone. As it states in What Are the Dangers of Texting While Driving , "" a lot of the danger lies. With so many people on the road using highly distracting devices, the potential for accidents-and thus injuries and fatalities-is incredibly high."" This shows that statically that texting while driving is harmful in many ways.

Texting while driving reports shot as new technology increased. Proving that driving while using these new technologies was a disadvantage. According to Texting and Driving Accident Statistics ,1/4 accidents happens because of one's interaction with a cell phone. This a huge chunk in these accident statics proving the fact that interacting with a cell phone is dangerous and should not be allowed.

Driving while texting is not a good match, leading into many different and dangerous accidents. There are so many accidents that has been reported due to texting/ interacting with one's phone that it is safe to say that Drivers should NOT be able to use cell phones when on the road.",1
"""Phones And Driving""

A common killer in america today is driving while looking at your cell phone. Drivers feel like it is more important to see who texted them instead of looking at the road which causes fatal accidents. Drivers must keep the eyes on the road to look for issues and problems in the road or to see if the light is green. Which as why there are campaigns supporting no driving while texting movement with a speech ""It can wait"" signifying that any text that comes through your phone can wait.

In 2015, reportedly 391,000 injuries were caused from drivers looking at cell phones and texting while driving. The statistics shows that drivers should never be allowed to look down at their phone while driving and if caught the driver should receive a ticket. Not only are you putting yourself in danger but others as well when look down for even one second the consequences will be fatal.

Furthermore, the ""It can wait"" campaign started by the phone company AT&T in 2010 to raise awareness by spreading this message. This message was put on billboards, tv commercials, and cereal boxes. A phone company wanted drivers to know that looking at your cell phone while driving can wait for when you are not driving.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to look at their phones while driving. For it can prove quite dangerous and fatal if its done. The the text can wait until the vehicle is not is parked in a suitable parking spot. Drivers should not even have look at the phone the phone should be out of reach and out of sight of the driver while they are driving

"The use of cell phones are important to teens, children, and even adults in everyday life. Although sometimes it may be dangerous to use cellular devices while you drive, we also need them for important decisions. These reasons vary in situations where we have calls, GPS, or even change the song that you might not want to listen to at the time. Therefore, the use of cellphones while one is driving is important.

A GPS (global positioning system), helps lots of us drivers pinpoint our location, and take us from one place to another. However sometimes, we may need to change our destinations or even stop the route while under the control of a vehicle. For example, say if a lady was driving to a destination, and she started to change the location because she typed in the wrong one, that would be a good reason as to why us humans should be able to use our phones while we drive. Without us being able to use our phones to do so while we drive, we could all possibly end up at different places than we expected to be. This can go as far as to restaurants, stores, and different people houses.

Phone calls from our family, friends, and even ones who you work with are important to pick up while you're driving. To help out with these situations, you have equipment that can be placed on your window so you won't have to look away from the street to answer your device. For example, if you're receiving an important call, and you are aware that you cannot look away, this object will help you and make it easier for you to be on your phone. By doing this, this can reduce the chance of injuries and accidents by allowing someone to focus on the road and a important call at the same time.

Using your phone to change songs on the radio or your own device is significant. For example, you can have kids in the car and the song might have inappropriate words for them. Because of that, you may have to use your phone to change songs if it is off the device. Also, if the person doesn't want to listen to the songs that are playing, then the need for someone to be able to use their phone while driving is important to us.

In conclusion, the needs that we have to access our phones while driving is necessary. If we weren't able to answer calls, use the GPS, change music with the object then things would be different. We could have emergencies and problems that needs to be taken care of as soon as possible. Therefore, the human race should be able to use their phones while driving to accomplish these needs. If car manufactures could make the hands free device more safe for us drivers, everybody should be able to use their phone while driving.",1
"Phones and Driving

Using your phone while driving is of the most common ways people die or get others killed in America. With this problem, nobody thinks that it could be them that's dead and on the news from using their phone while driving. There are countless reasons why this needs to come to an end in our society.

Many states have acted on the matter and have a hands free ban while driving. Nobody ever needs to use their phone while driving, you are supposed to be concentrated at all times while behind the wheel. One of the main reasons people are still disregarding this rule is because they're using their phone most times throughout the day and can't be without even while driving. The National safety council reports that phone use while driving causes approximately 1.6 crashes in a single year, also that 1 in every 4 car crashes has to do with phone usage while driving. Laws that were placed on these problems are slowly but surely getting rid of this problem over time.

Everybody across the nation should tell their loved ones that it is never safe to do so and should attempt to stop this by any means necessary. Nobody wants to see any friends or family taken away from them by something that could easily be fixed. Act today and be the voice that can save many lives, including your friends and family .",1
"Driving with and without the use of a cell phone:

Nowadays when you are walking or even driving you see a lot of people with a smartphone, that's because 61.62% of our population has one. There are a lot of reasons why people are on their cellphones while driving. As well there are pros and cons of driving while texting. Throughout many years the stats of accidents while on their phone has also increased.

Each year there are approximately 1.6 million car accidents throughout the United States. Many of those are accidents due to texting and driving, almost 400,000 injuries a year. This means 1 out of 4 car accidents are due to distractions while texting and driving. There is an average of 3287 deaths a day, just by usage of cellphones while driving. Stats show that the average age of accidents occur during young ages 17-30 years of age. In a survey, people were asked how many people text and drive and their answer was pretty shocking reporting more than 80% of the people has or done while driving.

As to all the things there are pros and cons, but in this topic, there are cons and thoughts what people think are pros. Nowadays technology is an everyday usage, us being away or not checking our phones consistently makes us feel the need to be plugged in. The majority of the scenes where people do this act end up in a car crash. Hurting yourself or even getting killed is not the only danger you take, you also put other peoples life in danger. In some cases you could hit someone hurt them really badly, or even kill them. Remembering what you did to the other person would not be your only punishment, you could go to jail and spend a long time in their just for the distraction of a couple seconds. Some of the reasons why people think its a good thing is because they feel the need to be communicated with the world just in case something bad happens or basically if something bad happens on their way and feels the need to communicate it with someone or has an emergency. There are also many more reasons why people are on their phone.

Every person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all. You would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5, but it's not that commun seeing people on a phone call. One of the main reasons it's obviously texting. Another big reason is facebook, snapchat, any social media. A big reason is the camera, women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves, while on the other side guys have the trend to speed, or drive recklessly and record it to show it off. You also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather. When people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies.

In conclusion, texting and driving is really not a great idea, while it comes to texting or being on a phone call. That important text you need to answer or send can wait a couple minutes while you get to somewhere safe. Risking your life and others just to get that good quality picture is not worth it. People around you that care about you, will truly understand that you couldn't answer in that exact moment.",1
"Texting & Driving

Everyday around the United States studies show that one out of ten people are killed by drivers that are distracted by their phones and about 1500 are critically injured. One of the most dangerous and distracting things you could possibly do is texting while driving. It is very dangerous because people who text and drive are putting extra attention onto their phone and that takes away their sight of the road which raises the chances of that person losing control of the vehicle which can cause a fatal crash that can injure the driver, injure another person or even kill the person. When a person is using their phone, their thinking about everything else besides concentrating on their surroundings and driving.

The statistics are very poor, because according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in 2011 3,331 were involved in car accidents and unfortunately died because of a distracted driver on his phone, and 387,000 were severely hurt in vehicle crashes. Also according to a recent search by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute revealed that drivers who are looking at their phones are twice as likely to crash or come close to crashing than those who are paying attention to the road. These statistics are becoming more regular as people start to use their phone more and more everyday, especially those of younger ages.

For this reason it is extremely that we find different ways to terminate this terrible habit of texting and driving. To me I think that one of the best ways to cut this habit is to just turn off your phone while driving. Doing this will keep the driver focused on the road and not the buzzing and ringing the phone makes, this will also stop the driver from texting. Another way is that there are actually apps that can disable your phone while you're driving and another app that can text that person and tell them that you're driving and you'll text them back later. These are some great apps that we can use to our advantage and stop our habits of texting and driving. A great way to stop looking at your phone is that if you have a friend or another person in the car, have them check the phone while you're driving so you don't have too.

Something that is highly important is that a lot of the states have begun to pass a couple laws that orders drivers to completely stop texting and driving. But we need to be profound: none of these laws will work efficiently if the people of the society don't understand that texting while driving could have immaculate consequences, not only for the people driving but also other bystanders and innocent people. In my opinion I don't think that answering your phone is more important than your life and other people's lives. Using your phone can wait until you get where you need to be.",1
"Phones and Driving

In this age of the world almost everyone has a phone of some kind and this includes drivers among us. Phones usually are a little distraction nothing more, but when they are driving that distraction can become deadly. In recent years the fatalities by car wreck have gone up dramatically and usually the reason these days is texting while driving. In most states if you are caught you will have some sentence or a fine of some kind. It doesn't even have to be texting that distracts a person from driving, it can be from kids in the car to the radio.

In the state of georgia there is a pretty new law called the ""hands free law""which tells drivers that they can't even touch their phones while driving. When drivers are not parked even at stoplights if their caught on their phones they will get a fifty dollar fine. The law makers made this in mind to make people not take any selfies or videos or anything like that. In reality people will try even harder and be more reckless to try and do the videos their doing. On the other hand though they say that dash cams are ok to use.

However, there are exceptions to this law such as using stereo bluetooth speakers in the car with spotify. Another exception they make is for directions apps like google maps. They also make exceptions for informing the authorities about a crime or something similar. While they said we can listen to music or streams or stuff like that we can't touch our phones while doing so. Given these reasons i don't think that drivers should be able to use their phones while driving.

"Required Essay: Phones & Driving

There are many reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving vehicle. First of all, it can be very dangerous using cell phones while driving. Because when you use cell phone you get distracted with other things you are doing and things around you. When you are driving your focus should be in driving not in your phone or in any other things. There are high chances of you getting into an accident. Furthermore, getting in an accident that might really affect your bank balance and you don't want that. For example, when you hit a car in accident and if it's your fault you have to pay for that person's car repairing and for that person's medical also your insurance will go higher. That will really affect your bank balance. Lastly, I have seen and read most of the people who gets in an accident they are teenagers. Teenagers they keep using phones and driving in the same times that's how most of that accident happens. If you don't care about your own life there is more people who cares about you especially your parents. So at least Think about them before doing something. So there are my top three reasons why no one should use phones while driving.",1
"In the world we live in, everyone has a cell phone. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. They should not because it is a distraction, and the call or text can wait.

The call or text can wait because you have to take your eyes off the road to answer or reply. Many times when you're texting and driving you misspell words and then you have to go back and correct it. So therefore when you go back and correct it your eyes are still off the road. This also means you are risking your life and someone else's life by being on the phone . In addition this leads to my next reason.

Cell phones are a distraction. They are a distraction because if you get a notification you're going to look for your phone. You can look down for 1 second and anything can happen. Also when people talk on the phone they are distracted. They have a tendency to look ways that they aren't supposed to and they drive crazy.

In conclusion drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. It is a distraction and the call or text can wait. Remember when you drive you have to drive for yourself and drive for others too. So try to avoid texting or answering and call while driving especially if it's just a friend.",1

I think people should be able to use there phone while driving because they mite need it for GPS or the mite need it to make or answer an important phone call. I believe that if u know the risks of driving then they should be able to use there phone. Mind being if u don't drive that good then don't use your phone and drive that could be very dangerous.

Using your phone can be dangerous either way but even more dangerous if u don't drive that good. Because u can be driving on the expressway and u going 70 mph the u look at your phone and u already swerving then look down for a second the crash. It should be your own decisions to use your phone while driving.

The only downside of using your while driving is that u don't text and drive. Texting and driving can be the most dangerous thing u can do while driving. Texting and driving kills more the 80 people a month. U can use you're an any way but don't text and drive.

"Phone and Driving

The majority of humans own and operate a cell phone on a daily basis. The use of cell phones has increased throughout the years. Since the creation of phones it has made it easier to connect with a person. People also like the ability of being reached within seconds. With phones increasing there been an increase in automobile accidents. Although people think that phones are necessary for emergency people do not focus while driving. Phones are the main reason for automobile accidents, and it distracts the person while driving.

Phones have been the major cause of automobile accidents. Since it distracts the driver from the road. While using a phone it becomes harder for the driver to be completely focus. There have been studies that indicate that phones leads to crashes. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"" (Snyder, 2002). It shows how people's awareness and concentration decrease while being on their phone. It distracts drivers and causes them to not pay attention in moving traffic.

Even though there are many reasons for using a phone while driving there are some benefits. The main benefit is the ability of communicating within seconds. It also gives people security having a phone. In an emergency, ""having a cell phone can allow help to reach yo quickly and could possibly save lives"" (Kingston, 2019). Phone help with being connected with others. Also it makes it easier for people to send their location in an emergency. With modern phones it becomes easier to find their exact location.

In conclusion, this paper has talked about both sides of the use of phones and not using phones while driving. Even though phones give people security it also unfocus the person while driving. If people keep using phone it would increase automobile accidents. Its people's responsibility to be safe on the roads. Not only for their safety but for the safety of others.

"Apple, Samsung, LG, Google Pixel, etc. all these company's make and design smartphones. Most people in the world own smartphones. People use smartphones so much that it can become a distraction. A big distraction is while driving people start using their phones and put themselves and other drivers at risk. Texting and driving is a big distraction putting people in harm's way because people cannot do two things at once and most accidents occur because of texting and driving.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in the world. Most people get addicted to their phones that they can't live without them. People need to have their phones on them all the time. When they get notifications they have to look no matter what they're doing. When they get a notification while driving they get distracted so now they're not focused on the road that puts them and other people in danger. Cell phones distract people from the road which may lead to an accident. Some people think they can multitask by driving and texting but that's not the case.

Multitasking is a hard thing for human beings. Even if you think you are multitasking the human brain can only process things one at a time. While people are texting and driving they are only focus on one thing so they can crash at any moment because they're not focused on the road. This puts everyone in danger. This is why states have put strict laws so that people wouldn't text while driving. This is why texting while driving is a leading cause for car accidents.

When it comes to car accidents, most of them occur because the driver was distracted.

Most likely they were using their phones. It was reported that, "" A distracted driver is a motorist that diverts his or her attention from the road, usually to talk on the cell phone, send a text message or eat food."" As it states most accidents are because of cell phone distraction this is why they made laws to try and stop texting while driving. Right now this is the leading cause for car accidents and we have to try and prevent it from continuing.

Texting and driving should not be permitted anywhere as it distracts the driver putting everyone in danger. All this causes people to die or get severely injured this is why people need to put their phones down for a while and focus on the road. This way we have a safer environment for everyone.",1
"Do you think drivers should use their phone at any capacity while driving? Some people may think different but I think it's very dangerous. There have been 3,153 injuries, and 424,000 deaths dealing with texting while driving. Texting while driving has been happening all over the world, and for many many years since the cell phone has been made. It also takes away the perception of the road meaning everyone would be taking their eyes off the road. Social media is another liability while texting in the car.

Having the phone while driving has been a daily part of life since the phone was invented in 1972. Texting while driving has been a part of daily life since messaging was put into use on the cell phone. People urge to text and drive because once they get that first text they don't want to stop replying. ""Texting while driving and other bad behaviors have fueled a spike in motor vehicle deaths in Georgia and across the nation over the past two years"".

People don't understand the dangers and necessities of keeping your eyes on the road, because the death rate continues to go up and on one care to change it.

There are many different types of phones all across the world not even in the United States alone. ""The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that 80% of all car crashes are related to driver inattention"". There are overall seven state with bans on cell phones in the hand while driving. No one understands why everyone all over the world desires to keep their phone in their hand at all times be it always happens. Even when there is a passenger in the car for example a Jamaican man and his family he would sometimes still text and drive if he wife weren't in the car.

No one can see while you're looking at your phone that's the reason while everyone is crashing on the road now a days. Texting is in one of the top ten categories of the most dangerous causes of death in the U.S lone. Technology in vehicles are causing drivers to be on the phone as well taking their eyes off the road. Looking at your phone cause the driver to either hit a bystander or an animal. ""Statistics state that on average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to distracted driving"".

No matter what everyone should just put the phone down while driving because everyone would be even more safe.

In conclusion there are many different views on whether the phone should be allowed in the car while driving. There are many problems with phones being in cars and since it has been made accidents are still going to happen. Cars are being totaled, lives are being lost, and people are being injured because of phone and driving. Sometimes many would think if the phone wasn't invented would the death rate have stayed the same or would everything be different. Phones don't need to have that big of an impact of people's lives because that's not good or healthy for any body's life. Phone shouldn't be allowed in these days, or the future of any body's hands in a car because of all the risks and what has happened in the past.",1
"Ever since cell phones became popular in the late 1990's, in America, they have evolved from being simple mobile dialing and answering machines to basically mini computers that allow humans to now do a multitude of things like surf the internet and bank online to name a few. Unfortunately, in rent years humans have used cell phones to answer and receive calls, text and surf the Internet.

As a result, cell phones have caused automobile accidents which have unfortunately led to deaths.

In my opinion, drives should not be able to use cell phones if they are held in ones hand, however, they should be allowed to use cell phones in ""hands free"" mode as follows while operating a vehicle:

1. to talk and/or talk text via Bluetooth, 2. to use maps and/or a navigation system and 3. for entertainment purposes such as listening to music and the ability to watch movies, especially during cross county travel.

Talking and texting while driving has become a ""hot topic"" in recent years mainly because of more and more humans using cell phones on a daily basis and the rise in traffic accidents due to talking and/or texting. I will agree that drivers can get distracted while talking on the cell phone while using their hands.

I will also agree that drivers can get distracted by using their hands to text because the driver is constantly looking up and down which results in loss of concentration and attention to other drivers and to the road. However, a solution to the problem would be to mandate that all drives must use ""hands free"" mode via Bluetooth or you will be in violation of the law and can get a traffic ticket if seen using your hands.

Before the cell phone, humans used actual paper maps to navigate the world.

Until the early 2000's when cell phones came with satellite navigation via Goggle maps, software and apps such as MapQuest and Waze which allow the driver to get directions to their destinations via the cell phone.

Navigation systems usually speak to the driver via the sound system in the vehicle which allow the driver to not use their hands.

However, there are times that drivers use their hands to see the maps, therefore resulting in a traffic accidents. A solution to this issue would be to require all drivers to use the ""hands free"" mode while using navigation systems.

The Internet has allowed for cell phones to have the ability to play radio stations from all over the country and not just local radio stations.

The Internet has also allowed for humans to download their favorite music to their cell phones which they can then listen to the music via the phone.

The Internet has also given humans the ability to watch television and movies via the cell phone by using apps such as YouTube and Netflix.

Music has probably least likely to cause drivers to get distracted.

However, movies have most likely caused traffic accidents because the driver looks up and down at the screen losing concentration while driving.

A solution to this problem would be that the driver can only listen to music while driving and only the passengers can watch movies while the driver is driving, which are all ""hands free"" solutions.

In conclusion, it is my opinion that drivers should be able to use cell phones in the capacity of ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle.

The actual cell phone device is really not the issue that causes traffic accidents, it is basically the user lacking concentration, not paying attention and not using hands free mode that causes traffic accidents.

Although humans will still get into traffic accidents while using ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle, it will most certainly cut down the number of accidents in the United States and around the world.",1
"Cell phones Privileges

Cell phones have been around for years but just in the past few they have become hazardous, due to people using them in cars while operating them. They have cause death, serious injuries, and damage to personal and government property. I believe phones should not be used in vehicles without a hand-free Bluetooth system or passenger who can speak while you focus on what's in front of you. There's no age group or sex that hasn't been the cause of an accident due to their cell phones. There are many reasons technology shouldn't be allowed in vehicles while behind the wheel. There just as bad as drinking and driving. Cellphones are not okay while operating a vehicle.

Since technology has took thousands are at risk of crashing and dying. ""The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. Texting while driving is a contributing cause in 25% of all car accidents - resulting in almost 400,000 physical injuries. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving."" Phones have caused a chaotic distraction across America. How many more people must die before we give up on using cell phones and driving.

Not only does this distraction of cellphones while driving kill, but its costing a fortune of money that doesn't help our economy. ""Distracted Driving and Its Economic Impact Highway crashes cost $871 billion a year - $277 billion in physical damage and another $594 billion in ""societal harm,"" such as traffic congestion and lost productivity, according to the agency."" Our country is trillions of dollars in debt and this doesn't help. Over one and half trillion dollars is because of distracted drivers.

There thousands of reasons that you should not be able to use your cellphone while driving. However, hands free cellphone Bluetooth or headset is okay if you're not getting distracted. I have proven the main harmful impacts of users on there cellphones while driving. It is hazardous, costly. and it kills not to mention police have writing tens of thousands of tickets annually, but the total number of summons written has dropped and risen over the past five years, according to the state Judiciary. These are many reason I believe you shouldn't be able to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle of any kind.",1
"In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours an average of 660,000 people are using electronic devices while driving. People from ages 16-24 are mostly involved in car accidents having to do with texting and driving.

When you text and drive you put not only your life at risk, but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.

Texting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing a death. When you text and drive you are distracted and are not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving is bad and also illegal.

Additionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.

In conclusion, texting and driving does not need to occur. do not do anything else in your car besides paying attention to the road and having both of your hands on the steering wheel. People around the world need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in. too many people di because others are too worried about their phones instead of the people around them.",1
"Phone & Driving

People are constantly using their phones for different things. There are many great uses for phones. We use them for work, to contact some, even to watch videos and school research. Phones are one thing we tend to keep in our hands. However this hasn't proven to be to the best choice. NHTSA say that at least 1000 people are injured because of phone usage while driving a vehicle. In this paper I will be talking about why I think we shouldn't use cellphones while driving.

It has been proven that cell phone usage leads to deaths. Motor vehicles crash daily and usually there are many fatalities as a result of cell phone usage. Most accidents are caused by teen drivers that just have to pick up their phone while driving. The main casualties are pedestrians. In the year of 2018 alone, around 400,000 people were injured or killed. It is sad that lives are destroyed by one senseless act such as picking up a phone while driving.

Drivers that are seen and caught risk very serious punishment. The average cellphone while driving violation cost about $300 per incident. This violation also comes with a minimum of four points towards your license. This can cost you in other ways as well such as higher insurance premiums. Once you receive fifteen points your license is revoked and you are now left with finding other means of transportation. If you are found guilty of hitting someone you can face one to twenty years in prison. One second of picking up a cellphone may lead to lifetime of misery.

Driving while using a cellphone may lead to a lifelong change with many effects.

Imagine for just one moment a teen has friends or even siblings in the car with them; suddenly the phone rings. The teen looks away from the road to answer or check the text message, hits a pothole, loses control of the vehicle and in now in oncoming traffic. The vehicle crashes killing some of the passenger if not all involved.

You now have several different families that have been united by a tragedy that shouldn't have been. Drivers in the oncoming traffic may be injured as well and now have a lifetime of bills or life changing injuries and scars to hunt them of the day that some teen made a conscious choice to pick up a cellphone and drive. One moment is all it ever takes to change a life.

As you can see from the research people are affected by distracted drivers. You risk serving jail time and giving up your freedom. You can lower the causalities by simple not operating your vehicle while on a cellphone. People would worry less and feel safer if they were assured that you are being responsible and choose not to text or talk while driving.

"Required Essay: Phones & Driving

Starting in the 1996, cell phones became very important to people's everyday life. Cell phones started as huge bulky items that were not able to fit in a pocket. Now, they are an everyday item that is carried in someone's pocket, purse, etc. After they became wireless they played a ever bigger role in life. Cell phones were starting to be used in cars for GPS and playing music through bluetooth. People started to take advantage of using a cell phone while driving and things went down from there. People should be able to use their cell phones while driving for navigation to wherever they are going , to contact anyone for an emergency, and hands free answering phone calls.

GPS navigation system is one of the main reason people use their cell phones while driving. If driving from Georgia to New York with a map or using road signs, because you can't use cell phones while driving, you are going to make a lot of mistakes and many u-turns. Using a cell phone for navigation is the best way to get to your destination the fastest and easiest. According to Baldwin Ellis, "" Cell phones allow users to call for directions when they cannot find their destinations. Furthermore, many cell phones have GPS technology that provide turn-by-turn directions to any destination and maps that provide real-time traffic information."" (Ellis). This shows that GPS navigation on cell phones are helpful to show real information going on around the area and send you a better route. While using the GPS you can also talk on the phone while GPS gives you directions on where to go at the same time.

Most people like to talk to people on the phone while driving. Whenever your phone rings it's an instinct to go reach for it and pick it up. It's more safe to listen and talk to the person on the phone through the car than holding the phone up to your ear and driving with one hand. With bluetooth in a car, you wouldn't be breaking the hands free law. According to "" Benefits to Having Bluetooth in Your Car"" article, ""the Bluetooth capabilities you end up with will save you from receiving a ticket and also making it easier for you to keep your hands on the wheel."". This shows that bluetooth is the key to not breaking any law your state made about hands free. Using Bluetooth can also help with texting and driving. Instead of picking up your phone and texting some back, you can use bluetooth the say your message and send text out loud. According to "" Benefits to Having Bluetooth in Your Car"" article, ""Many offer Bluetooth capabilities, which will help to alleviate the temptation of manually texting."" . Don't even think of reach for your phone when you hear you got a text just get Bluetooth in your car. It's better to get bluetooth than being in a car accident for texting and driving.

You will need your phone while driving if something serious happened or is happening and you need emergency services quick. Without your phone, you would be stuck out on the road during the day or even night with no one to help. Most people definitely don't like to stop for people even when they see they're in trouble. According to ""NHTSA's Office of Emergency Medical Services"" , ""emergency telephone calls presented to the switchboard in May 2017 was 845,674, an average of 27.3 thousand per day."". This shows that many people use their phone to call EMS when any type of situation or car crash happens.

As you can see driving with your phone is not bad at all unless you make it bad. Although people make using cell phones bad, it's very helpful to everyday things you do in a car. You wouldn't like to sit in silence not knowing where to go and then suddenly your car breaks down and you don't know what else to do. Cell phones are needed in everyday life. Why try and take that from us just because we are in a car, but there are ways to help prevent anything going bad while using them while driving.",1
"Is a reading a message more important than you life?

Texting and driving why is people putting their lives and other people lives in danger to read a message. We will have to find a understanding of why people are texting and driving when it's against the law. Texting and driving started to evolve around 2013 and it also has become a huge distraction to those who can not stay off their phones. Some texting and driving accidents occurs almost every hour. Just last year the cell phone being used while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually. Also texting and driving causes more accidents then driving under the influence.

I believe people really don't think they can get into a car accident since they want to read and texting people back. Not only that you putting your life other the line you putting other people lives on the line. Plus it's against the law to text and drive also it has been banned in 47 states. The fine of texting and driving is $20 to $400 dollars. In the world right now 660,000 people attempt to use their phones while texting a driving but once again the cell phones distraction is alarmly high so they is a 75 percent chance that they will be on they phone the entire time while their driving then they try to hide their phone when the police ride past..

Everybody was or has used their phone while texting and driving but only a few has been caught everywhere around the world. Reasons why accidents occurs because the moment you look away you stop paying attention to the road. So you don't know if another car or person is coming down the street but the moment you look back up from your phone then it's too late. Example last year during my junior year we had a speaker come in and he told us how he lost his 6 year old daughter due to somebody texting and driving. He said ""the person that killed my babygirl would never know how this feels i almost lost both of my kids but i lost the youngest one"" You really should think and care about if you should be texting and driving because you can end lives and crush that person heart if you killed somebody in the wreck also you will go to jail for reckless driving. . If you know somebody that's always text and drive ask them if the care about their life. It don't matter if they're driving to school, work, the store, or even up the street. Losing a love is the worst feeling you can possibly deal with. Always try to help a friend or family because everyday is not promised so you try to help them instead of them risking their life by texting and driving.

It's going to be a time where a loved one experiences a texting and driving or either is involved in and texting and driving accident. There is a 50% chance that and texting and driving accident will take someones life. That's why it is best if you do not touch your phone while driving and make sure that you seatbelt is on. Like you see on billboards it be left unread than dead because it always a high chance of an texting and drive accident. Therefore don't be a victim of the texting and driving just wait till its a good time to use your phone then text them back.",1
"Texting and driving is a serious issue, around 10 teenagers die daily from texting and driving. With over 500,000 drivers admitting to using a cellphone while driving, and at least 25% of those being teens our future generations are growing more irresponsible on the roads. Car crashes are the main cause of death for teens considering texting and driving is over five times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving. With the increase in people who text and drive the risk of being on the road also increases.

Distracting driving is the cause of over half of all car accidents and is most commonly found in ages 16-19. Parents need to be teaching their children the importance of staying focused behind the wheel. Parents need to make sure that their kids are staying safe on the roads and safe around other drivers. There are multiple car trackers that parents can access to track their kids on the roads and some parents even prohibit taking a phone while driving

Future generations are continuing to text and drive regardless to the numerous laws restricting distracted driving. A lot of teens continue to text and drive even though most of them are familiar with their states driving laws. However, most teens are not aware that distracted driving is more dangerous than drinking and driving and fail to see that their phones reduce their reaction speed and hand eye coordination behind the wheel.

If the countless driving laws that restrict texting and driving don't stop you from checking your phone behind the wheel then think about the risk you are putting on yourself and all the drivers around you. For a lot of drivers who struggle staying off their phone, they can start off by simply turning off their phone and putting it in the console. Other features like Bluetooth and do not disturb mode also help drivers keep their eyes on the road.

So if you ´re thinking about responding to your friend while driving, just simply wait until you have time to respond. There is no point in risking you and everyone around you over a stupid text. Just turn the phone off and wait until you ´re done driving to ensure the safety of all drivers and decrease the risk of a fatal accident.",1
"Is it really important to stay connected to people every minute of every day? Even while driving? Texting and driving is a plague that has ravaged the lives of many people all over. There are way too many people dying because if this outrageous act. People really have to take notice in how dangerous this problem is.

As hard as it is to take your eyes away from your phone, it needs to happen. Sending a simple text is not worth a life. It can be extremely crucial, especially when it comes to texting and driving. Millions of people have died and killed others due to this epidemic. Texting and driving has been the leading cause of car accidents in the recent years.

Texting and Driving is probably the most common in the death of teens. Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but to all of the cars surrounding the person that is driving the vehicle. In agreement with many people, texting and driving is similar, if not Identical to drunk driving. Using your cellular device impairs your vision and causes you to lose focus on the road. We as a nation should make stricter laws enforcing ""No texting and driving"" or creating a system that disables your phone the moment you pull out of the driveway.

Even though texting and driving is a well-known known issue our young and older adult are blind to the consequences of it. As a result of texting becoming so popular, the percentage rate of the deaths due to these types of accidents have rapidly increased. Texting and Driving puts so many unknowing people at risk. People think that being connected to other is more important than focusing on the road ahead. While being behind the wheel of a moving vehicle, drivers should never direct their attention to their cellphones or any other mobile device.

Texting can be extremely hazardous when you are behind the wheel of a moving vehicle. Texting and driving is most frequent in young adults. The dangers of texting and driving results in the increase of deaths annually, because texting is so popular. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer.",1

Today people are so easily distracted, so many people get in wrecks because of it. Thousands of people are killed or injured in accidents because someone had to send one more text or take one more picture. Imagine if a loved one left there house to visit for supper, and the never arrived. You would be terrified, then you get a call to be told that they have been in an accident. Of course it was by a young man distracted by his cell phone. People should not be allowed to be on there at all, not for any reason.

There are three types of distractions manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when your hands are off the wheel and not being used to drive safely, visual distraction is when your eyes are not on the road and are instead on your cell phone, last a cognitive distraction refers to taking your mind of driving and being more focused on your cell phone. Using a cell phone while driving uses all three types, which highly increases the chances of getting into an accident. ""People are as impaired when they drive and talk on the cell phone as they are when they are intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08%."" (""Distracted Driving Facts"")

If people are as distracted as a driver that is intoxicated while using a cell phone while driving is just as if not more dangerous on the road. Also, there are most likely more people on their cell phone while driving than people under the influence of alcohol on the road.

Not only are there problems with endangering other and yourself, there are also economic problems. ""Economic losses from distracted driving could total $46 billion a year."" (""Background on: Distracted driving"").

""NHTSA released a study in May 2014 which focused on behavioral factors that contributed to 32,999 highway fatalities and 3.9 million injuries in the U.S. in 2010 the study found that those crashes cost $277 billion in economic losses and $594 billion in societal harm, for a total of $871 billion that year""

('Background on: Distracting driving""). Therefore, we are also losing billions of dollars a year due to distracting driving, Which could lead to are government increasing taxes to get that money back. Not only will it put our country in debt but maybe even people living here.

Finally, the laws for driving and being on your cell phone should be a lot more strick, and enforced stronger. We cannot have innocent people getting injured or killed every year because people are being distracted by their cell phones. Also, we can't let our country get in debt because of this either, no one wants taxes to be raised just to pay back all that money, instead let it be used for schools or other educational purposes. Last, Lets all put are put are phones away and keep the roads safe for the people of the future.

Today's life all around is being heavily influenced by technology. Almost everyone owns a piece of technology of some sort, whether it being a cell phone or computer. People are so accustomed to using it they they are even willing to risk the safety of themselves and whoever else is caught in between. Yes, this is about cell phone usage while driving. Phone use while driving should be banned because it is a safety hazard for the driver and/or passengers involved and is comparable to driving under the influence.

First, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in a vehicle because it is a safety hazard. Is trading your life for a text message really worth it? Studies have shown that many deaths and injuries on the road are caused by distracted drivers. Usually the distractions end up being simple texts and notifications that can wait. Better to respond late than never.

Drivers should be banned from using cell phones while driving because it is comparable to drunk driving. Now that is said because both distracted and drunk drivers share the same trait. They both do not show enough mental focus to manage a vehicle. Both driving types have become an epidemic in today's era and some are even going as far as saying that distracted driving is even more dangerous. Drivers who text while operating the vehicle are 8 times more likely to crash than drunken drivers according to a Fox News 13 study.

In conclusion, cell phone usage while driving is proven extremely hazardous and selfish. We are doing it everyday and not even realizing how much we are putting our lives in danger. A text should never be worth the cost of losing a life.",1
"""Phones and driving""

Today's generation, phones are becoming an issue on the roads and putting people's lives at risk.

Phones should not be allowed to be touched or played on as you are on the roads so that you are fully aware of what's going on in your surroundings and also not taking your eyes off the roads. Texting while driving may ruin yours or another person's life.

There are a lot of risks that could happen and put your life or someone else's lives in danger. Most people pick up the phone because they say it's important, but even then the phone would be a distraction. Take a moment to sit and think about how many accidents occur because of a text, now think about in old times when texting while driving was not a problem at all.

Authorities put down strict detailed laws about having your phone in your hand while driving. Each offence doubles every time you get caught but this law was hardly effective because no one is taking the safer advice to insure the safety of yourself and others on the roads. The fines would turn into something more serious and if you got into a wreck, injuring another person you could more than likely spent some jail time.

I know phones shouldn't be allowed to be messed with while you are driving because imagine if it were you in the situation and getting into a wreck all because someone was paying attention to their phone and not the road. You could lose it all in a blink of an eye or you could make someone else lose everything, don't be that person because either one there are causes and effects to your actions even if you didn't get hurt , you probably hurt someone else that has family that loves them like crazy.

"Boom!! Disbelief and fear filled my mind as I lye on my side, sandwiched between the cold, soft dirt and the hot, slick metal of the car. The weight of the car pressed down on the lower half of my body with monster force. It did not hurt, my body was numb. All I could feel was the car hood's mass stamping my body father and farther into the ground. My lungs felt pinched shut and air would neither enter nor escape them. My mind was buzzing. What had just happened. I could smell the engine, And the burnt-chemical of the airbag propellant.

The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.",1

Since the start of mobile devices in 2005, sixteen percent of car crashes are caused by distractions of mobile devices. Most being teenagers. Texting and driving has cause many fatal accidents. As of July 1,2018, Georgia is now a hands-free state.

Because I have brought up the hands-free law, let us discuss it. Drivers are not to have any mobile devices in their hands. They're required to use: speakerphone, earpiece, bluetooth, or an electronic watch. While driving a driver can not send messages, read social media, or make videos. These reasons cause accidents. If a driver is: reporting a crash, medical emergency, fire, suspicious activity, or hazardous road conditions is the driver allowed to use their mobile devices.

The vast majority of car crashes in Georgia have been in rear-end crashes, single-car crashes and crashes by drivers from 15 to 25 years-old. There are 15 states that have passed the hands-free law. In those fifteen states, they have saw a 16 percent decrease in fatalities. The fine for being caught is: First Offense $50 and one point on your license, Second Offense $100 and two points on your license, Third Offense $150 and three points on your license.",1

Phones and techknowledgey have changed a lot through our time. We have had a major impact with phones from being able to call wherever your at and having having access to the internet on your phone. There have been positive and negative effects. One major negative effect is drivers being able to be on their phones while driving a car. Many people feel the need to get that last text off or need to get that quick phone call in at a red light. Sounds quick and simple but this is very dangerous. This is dangerous do to the fact that people can get into car wrecks due to the fact they are worrying about their phone at that moment.

People forget that the road is shared with other people and that it is shared with other people being on there phone. The National Safety Council have estimated 1.6 million car crashes due to phones and nearly 400,000 injured. This is caused by that one text you have to get off or picture that your friend posted you have to like. This isn't only caused by teens this is also caused by parents. But many people have to use there phone wherever there at. Such as businessmen and lawyers. Because of what they due they have be able to answer the phone wherever there at because of their job. But however this is hazardous because of the fact this is more riskier.

People have invented and a new way of answering the phone with a touch screen cars and voice hearing cars. Not only that there have been bluetooth headphones and car tripods. This has had a big impact on car crashes and helping people do stuff without having to grab their phones and loose attention of the road. A lot of hands free stuff is helping it to. Many laws have tightened up on this. If getting caught in certain states such as Georgia you will get in trouble. Under the age of 18 is prohibited for drivers with permits and class-d licence.

You have to be safe on the road because of the law and car crashes. Even if your not the one on your phone that doesn't mean the person behind you is not. Driving is dangerous and everyone should take precaution when driving. People will drive while being drunk or any other reason. Even with the laws that are not going to stop some people from doing it. As a society we should stop and take a chance to prevent anything harming to others because of the fact that we don't know who is all in the car.

"There is a lot of young teenagers and also adults getting into car accidents. Its because of our cellular devices, texting while driving. Teens and adults spend most of their time on their cellular devices. They are either on social media or texting. Nobody gets on the phone anymore its all about texting now. It is very dangerous to text while driving because you are putting more attention on texting then the road, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the car, and could get into a car accident or worse die. Texting and driving are worse than drinking and driving. Also, it's illegal to text and drive but people still do it cause they don't think about the consequences or what could happen. Texting and driving is one thing you should not be doing cause a lot of things could happen and texting is not worth risking your life. When you can wait to text the person back or just get on the phone using Bluetooth to the car and talk, its better than risking your life or someone else.

"In 1848 Antonio Meucci invented the first phone. Five years later in 1854 Charles Bourseul devised a phone. More than a century later in 1992 the first touch screen phone was invented it was called IBM Simon. This led to an evolution of phones that lasted almost thirty years later. Along with this phone evolution cars have had a just as impressive evolution as phone. In 1885 Karl Benz invented the first car. A year later Gottlied invented the engines for the car. Now although both inventions are very impressive, important, and developed well over time shouldn't mean we use them at the same time. That is why in this paper I'm going to explain why people shouldn't use cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

We have all been guilty of texting or scrolling through our social media. Sometimes we catch our self just checking our phones without any alerts going off. In the process of doing this has cause an elevation of car accident leading to serious body injures or even death. This has cause text and driving to be illegal in all states in the U.S. The national Safety Council report that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6million crashes each year, nearly 390,000 injuries occurs. Over a million Family has had to say goodbye to a family member because our need for our pones. It has increased rapidly in teen drivers because they were born in a point where, we use phones for ever thing. This doesn't just affect the victim's family the driver family will also be saying goodbye to a lover one. On May 5, 2015 texting and driving becomes illegal. Even through texting and driving didn't become illegal officially unit 2015 people have been going to jail long before then. If a person is hurt badly in an accident the driver who cause the accident will get two years of jail time and five year's probation for assault. Drivers under eighteen face a Five hunderd dollar fine and a year of a suspended license. All these facts are why I strongly disagree with texting and driving.

Using phone while driven is something that can change if you are welling. This is something that everyone has a problem with but its time that we found the solution to it now. Even if it you are telling and showing your children the proper way to operation a motor vehicle without your phone. Teens you can help by telling your friend not to use their phone when you're in the car with them. Explain the severity of the solution if they don't stop then exit the car for you own safety. This problem cannot be changed by on person, but a community of people can change it. The question now is are you willing to change it.",1

The issue of driving while the person is on the cell phone and is a major issue in Georgia and all the other states of America. Many accidents are happening daily, and people are losing their lives. This way many fatal accidents happened, and even small kids lose their lives. The Law has been made in Georgia that requires hands free driving, that means people can drive and talk on the phone without touching the phone. The Law is still not as helpful as expected because many people ignore law, many people's mind is still distracted, and many people still use their hands for navigation. The first reason is many people are still ignoring the Law because the charges are very low, if they get caught the insurance rates are nit going to hike much for them. Auto correct mishaps are hiking, and people are texting, even if it is not legal. It is more dangerous than drinking and driving. The Law must be strict and have a penalty that must be $1000 dollars or get arrested. Just in case of emergency, driver should pull over and talk on the side if the road. The second reason is many people have stressful jobs and they attend a conference call or any stressful situations in the family front while driving. This can distract their mind from driving and even the hands-free driving Law can't be helpful to prevent car wrecks. In this situation, the law should be made very strictly that person can talk hands free for only few minutes and eliminates other conversations while driving, only important conversations should be allowed. This law can save so many pedestrians too, who runs into a car wreck daily. One example is of an old lady in Atlanta she was run over by a driver in the evening and he didn't even stop after words two weeks ago, according to the news. The lady ended up dying on the street right on the spot. The third reason I have is people do not talk over the phone always, but people can use their phone for navigation, music and apps. So those things are also distracting. The law should be made by the government that they can tract the minimum usage while driving and even if they must set up the navigation, they can pull over and do it. So, they can pull over to the side to use the phone and should be made on the interstate and the street. In conclusion, the usage of the cell phone in the car can't be eliminated totally, because cellphones are for emergency use. By only communicating important things and concentrate on driving it can turn into a car wreck and pedestrians can get into an accident.

It is reported that cell phone use while driving leads to millions of crashes each year, and that's sometimes due to drivers trying to use their phones at any given time of the day, whilst behind a moving automobile. Even though smartphones have made it easier for people to stay connected, there's no need for letting the ins and outs of smartphones to run their lives. The distraction rates of cell phones are alarmingly high, given the fact that the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Those reasons stand alone, as to why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle.

Recent general cell phone statistics states that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Operating a vehicle requires someone to be fully focused on their surroundings, as they are not only driving for themselves, but every pedestrians and motorists. Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road and that's all it can take for and accident to happen within the blink of an eye or even worse, a causality.

94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving, and rightly so, it's bad enough that there are many distractions when driving, but eliminating one of the biggest distractions, is the beginning of heading into a right direction. The behavior of using cell phones while driving is common and dangerous.

In conclusion, to the many dangers of driving, cell phone should be on of the top priorities to eliminate. With the help of drivers who support this claim, it should be even more of a indication, because as sad as it is, people are not as educated about phones and driving, as they could be.",1
"Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years, most everyone has a cellular phone, and spends time on it daily.

These situations can be avoided if necessary actions are put in place to prevent them. People should take these actions to ensure that accidents are avoided, people should not use a cellular phone while driving for the safety of them and others.

On a phone while operating a mobile vehicle can be dangerous, people should not be on their phones while driving because of this. Accidents as well as other tragic events can happen, events that could change the driver or someone else's life. People should remain off their phones while driving, they could just park their vehicle or install hands free technology. That way, one could respond to messages or calls, while still driving without having to look at their phone. The driver should be considerate of the others around them and what the capability of texting and driving can do.

Texting while driving or, on the phone while driving is something drivers should already know what not to do. It is banned in some places and can be illegal. Those who are caught will be issued a citation by police, it is considered a violation and can add to the persons driving record.

"Phones and Driving

Using a cellphone while driving can be hazardous to everyone's health, even their lives. ""Arrive alive, don't text and drive"" is a common slogan that can be seen almost everywhere. Driving is already risky because most people don't know how to drive or they drive while intoxicated which makes using cellphones while driving ten times worse because it can be avoided. Using a cellphone while driving should not be allowed because it is the root cause of many accidents that we have today.

To start off, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating vehicles because it can cause car crashes. Most car crashes nowadays happen because of someone texting while driving. Teenagers and others cause crashes because of being distracted. According to ""edgarsnyder. com"", 1.6 million crashes are caused by texting while driving. No matter how bad one needs to answer a text, one shouldn't text back. A solution would be to pull over so that accidents can be prevented.

Additionally, studies have shown that driving while talking or texting on a cellphone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a greater risk of crashing into others. An extreme example would be if a person is walking across a crosswalk at a light intersection. The driver is approaching the light when the light was first green when he look then he started texting,while doing that the light turned red,so the person walked along the crosswalk by the time the driver looked up it was too late to stop on brakes. This is a prime example of being distracted while driving. It's sad but true while driving and texting it takes your attention off the road to see what's in front of you. According to ""braunslaw. com"", it states that the most common reasons pedestrians get hit is because,driving while texting or intoxicated harms others.

Lastly, it is important to note that driving while using a cellphone is illegal in most countries. It is also unlawful to drive in Georgia while using a cellphone. Georgia has a law called the hand held law. This law enables the use of cellphones without it being in your hand. The fines are steep, however, many drivers still use cellphones while driving. There are plenty of consequences for driving while using a cellphone. One is points on your license which means if you get a certain amount of points your license they can be took. Secondly you will have to take classes called ""mandatory road safety class""why do all this when you can just stay off your cellphones while driving.

Although some may argue that you should use your cellphone while driving, people are taking a risk while using their cellphones. According to the law, one's cellphones should be used for one reason only, to call 911. In this instance only, one can agree that cellphones, can be utilized.

To conclude, there is no question that using a cellphone while driving is a major distraction. Besides, being the law, everyone who drives should realize that being distracted while on the road puts everyone at risk!",1
"Cell Phones have been a very big problem relating to car accidents for the past few years, especially when it comes to teens. Cellphones are so dangerous when it comes to driving, so dangerous that they are sometimes the cause of deaths. Cell Phones shouldn't be used when driving or operating a vehicle. Cell Phones have especially been the cause of many teens deaths over the past years, this is why you always see so many signs on the freeway or even on billboards saying to not use your phone it is better to read a message later than to be dead or the cause of someone else's death.

Cell Phones have caused so many deaths or even fatal car accidents over the past. In an article by teensafe. com it states that, ""In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents''. This means that in 2015 there were a total of 9 people killed by distracted driving a day. Imagine you driving down the road not even knowing what the person next to you behind you may be doing, maybe their texting on their phone, answering a call, or even trying to set up their GPS, and then all of a sudden boom your into a major car accident that could be the death of you. Cellphones are very dangerous and will continue to be throughout the years and coming.

So many teens dream of having their own cars, some are lucky enough to actually be gifted it to them by their parents, the only scary part about it is that some teens don't understand the responsibility behind driving a vehicle without their parents or having someone to make sure they are driving safely. In an article posted by teenssafe. com it states,"" Each day,?11 teens? die in crashes caused by texting and driving."" That means 11 teens are dead each die due to a simple text sent or received while driving. Imagine if you had a teen child who drove their own vehicle, they could fall into being those 11 people who die a day, honestly anyone could fall into that category it's not just only teens.

Using your phone while driving is life risking and very dangerous, especially when the person behind the wheel is irresponsible. Just imagine losing a loved one due to someone who couldn't wait to send a text message till they go to their destination. In my opinion a cellphone or any form of technology should be out of anyone who is operating a vehicle hand. Maybe you wait to get home or wherever you must go, to send a message it's always better safe than sorry. Not only are the people operating the vehicle the ones in danger but sometimes even the passengers or the person in the other cars can be harmed or sometimes even end up dead.

In conclusion cellphones should be banned from being used while driving. It causes harm and sometimes even death to the one operating the vehicle or the people around him. Me as a teen agree with phones being banned, no one should put their lives or the lives of others at risk just because they couldn't wait to send a message. Others may say that people need their phones to contact people for work or children may have to contact their parents while at home, but people need to understand that earphones exist now that help you answer your phone that having it in your hand and of course texting can always wait, if its so important why not pull over instead or just a simple phone call. In the end parents should make sure their children are responsible while driving and adults should know better than to use their phone while driving.",1

Using your phone while driving, everyone knows it's illegal to do this. Using your phone while driving is dangerous thing to do because your looking at the road. You can't see where you're going or what's in front of you. This doesn't stop people from being on their phones though. In some cases though being on your phone for an emergency can help you be aware of where you need to be at that time.

Being on your phone posses a lot of danger for you and everyone around you. One person alone can cause a car rekt if they're on their phone. Because of this laws are put in place, but sometimes people will ignore those laws and be on their phone anyway. Causing a car crash or themselves panic a bit and speed up and nearly hit the car in front of them. Pretty much when you're driving, don't be on your phone because if you hear a car rev their engine you might think that the traffic is finally moving and hit the car in front of you because you were on your phone not paying attention.

You should have very low phone usage since you're driving. If someone calls you while you're driving and it's a emergency, you shouldn't stay on the phone for long. Staying on the phone will cause you to focus more on the phone, without you being careful like you normally would when you're driving, because you're trying to get somewhere fast since it's an emergency.

Instead of being careless of others around you, take your time when trying to get to that emergency, be mindful of what you're doing. You should never be on your phone and drive even if it's an emergency because you're caring about the other people around you, you just care to get to that emergency fast.

In some cases though being on your phone can be 'helpful' in a way. Let's say you're on your phone and you get a text, you're going to look at the text regardless even if you're driving. When looking at the text, make sure you've stop stopped somewhere to look at it or in this case when you're driving, look to see if any cars are around you. Obviously texting while driving is the worst thing you can do. So when you're going to text while you drive make sure you look to see how many cars are around, stay mindful of your surroundings, and if possible try to find a spot and stop so can see the text without endangering anyone else because you're not looking at the road.

In conclusion to being your phone when driving. You shouldn't do it even if it's an emergency or you just want to check your social media feed. You put yourself and everyone around you in danger because you're paying attention. If you decide to go on your phone though make sure you're stopped or at least almost no one is around you. Pretty much just stay off your phone when driving to keep yourself and others safe.",1
"Phones & Driving

There is no doubt that with how advanced technology has become in the past few years or so people have really advanced the technological possibilities. People have now started to make some of the AI's (artificial intelligence) like Alexa and Google Home. There are even some cars that allow you to ask it questions in order to find out the weather or finding the fastest route to take to work. Along with all of these technological advancements comes the ability to hook the phone up to a car using bluetooth. Now, should drivers be able to use their phones in the car while driving.

There are some really good uses for using the bluetooth phone hookup. For one in Georgia people are not allowed to drive if they have their phone in their hand. This is where the bluetooth phone hookup comes in handy because you can do in the car phone calls to work or to somewhere else. This feature can come in really handy because if someone takes a day off of work and someone from their work calls them and starts to ask questions they can answer those questions right then and there. That way if someone was ever needed to give someone some advice in their place of work they could just click a button and give them the advice over the phone.

There is also another use for the phone hookup to the car feature and that is so that someone can get notified if they do happen to have a family emergency. This is so that if someone does happen to have a family emergency and they are in the car already all they have to do is drive over to where the family emergency actually is. This is so that you can get notified if something bad does happen to someone's family member they won't have to wait until they get home to find out what happened.

Once again being that when they do find out instead of having to leave the house again to go and see what happened because this person is actually out and about all they have to do is go to the place of the emergency. This may be one of the sadder ways that a phone can be used for while driving but it still is one of the more important things.

The next reason for why people should be able to use their phone while driving is what if someone has to call the police. Using the bluetooth phone hookup feature that most cars have nowadays someone can call up the police and say that they need assistance with something. For instance let's say that someone has a very strong feeling that they are being stalked on the way home from work or somewhere else so they can then call the police for their assistance. This can also be a real life saver because this can also be used if someone's water breaks on the way to the hospital that way someone can go ahead and let the hospital know what is happening so someone won't have to wait. So, in short, phones can be used to save someone's life.

Phone's have been useful since the time of their invention. From the ability to be able to talk to people from a long distance away to making sure that people can keep in touch with their work life. Next, being able to keep in touch with the family making sure to be kept in the loop if something bad does happen. Lastly, being able to call the police and other emergency services to save lives. Phones are a necessity in day to day life which includes on the road.",1
"It has been statistically documented that cellphone-related accidents are increasing at an alarming rate. The usage of phone apps, texting, GPS mapping for directions, and social media sites have caused new laws and penalties to be passed due to cellphone-related injuries and deaths. In my opinion, drivers cell phone usage should be limited while driving with the usage of features such as hands-free options which should be mandatory.

According to the National Safety Council, 2019 Texting-While-Driving Report; the average cellphone related deaths is roughly 1,600,000 accidents per year. The top two most common distractions of automobile drivers are: talking on a cell phone and sending text messages.

Nationally the state of Georgia ranks number four by Expert Market research (www. expertmarket. com) with an average of 132.7 Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones.

However, the number of accidents caused by cell phone use while driving is severely under- reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (www. nhtsa. gov/distracted-driving). The issues of cellphone related problems with Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones continue to grow when you consider the victims who have either died or experienced severe injuries by vehicle operators who have struck bystanders due to a simple message or post.

Even though the statistics cause concern advocates for public safety feel that cell phone use while driving can be lifesaving for onsite emergencies, roadside assistance, and even responding to Amber Alerts. Both sides have valid arguments that have increased major phone carriers and company's like Apple Inc. have creating phone features such as voice activated Hands-free Calling, Do Not Disturb, and Disable While Driving to help minimize the possibility of anything cell-phone related occurring,

In conclusion, I feel that in the future cell phones and automobiles including cargo trucks alone will have driver algorithm and functions that will help decrease problems with cell phone- related driver issues. I do not feel that it is necessary to completely eliminate operating a cell phone while driving in case of a emergency especially health related or to even report kidnapping & human-trafficking which is a huge problem for the state of Georgia and nationally. Drivers need to be more mindful and obey the laws or be penalized by the new laws meant to protect people.",1
"Usage of Phones While Driving

Each year thousands of people die in car crashes because of the use of cell phones while driving. The number of these deaths increase with every year. This is a major problem, especially for teenage drivers who are new to the road. Teenagers are not experienced enough and can also be easily distracted by their phones. While driving, if not paying full attention to the road, a teenager or anyone else could easily crash or get into a dangerous situation such as running through a red light because they were talking on the phone. Many states have started to see an increase in the number of people who text and drive and this directly contributes to the growing number of car accidents. Because of this, many states, including Georgia have taken action in an effort to reduce the growing number of wrecks due to cell phone usage. However, it seems that these set rules are not as strict as they should be and many states are quite lenient with the laws. Cell phone use needs to be more restricted while driving any type of automobile.

The first reason cell phones should not be used while driving and should be more restricted is because it is actually illegal in the United States. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 14 states have prohibited all drivers from using handheld devices while driving. Additionally, 46 states have banned texting and driving. State legislatures have seen the exponential growth in texting and driving along with the increase of automobile accidents. Therefore, the majority of the states have made the decision to pass laws that prohibit handheld devices such as cell phones. Many people who use their cell phones while driving have tried to state that they have no problem focusing on their driving while also using their technology. They have said that they have used cell phones multiple times while driving and have not caused one accident. However, researchers have proven that a person who uses their cell phone in any form while driving, is 2.8 times more likely to get into a wreck. Texting while driving is even more dangerous with it being 23.2 times more likely to get someone in an accident. Just because it does not happen to everyone one, does not mean that thousands of people have not lost their lives because of this problem.

Thousands of innocent adults, teens and children lose their lives everyday because of the actions and choices of those around them. When teens or children are in a car with an adult who is using their cell phone while they drive, that adult is putting those kids' lives at risk.

48% of kids in their younger teenage years have been in a vehicle while the adult driver was texting. In addition to that, 1,600 kids in that age range lose their lives every year because of people using their phones while they drive. Cars are amazing innovations that can get anyone to where they need to be quickly and efficiently. However, put them in the hands of someone who is irresponsible and a safe car becomes a potential weapon.

This is why cell phone use needs to be more restricted. Using a cellphone while driving gives the driver inattention blindness and also a slower reaction time. These are symptoms of drunk driving as well. If one would not drive with their children in the car while they are intoxicated, one should not text and drive or use their cell phone at all. A quick text or peek at social media, is not worth an innocent life.

On a lighter note, another reason cell phone use should be restricted is because it will save money. Drivers who do not use their phones while they are driving have financial benefits even if they do not realize it. Imagine all the traffic tickets, accidents and increased insurance rates that every person who uses their cell phone while driving has to deal with. If cell phones are more restricted, people will save so much money. While it does depend on which insurance company a driver is signed with, it has been shown that if one is involved with car accidents due to cell phone use, their insurance rates rise potentially up to 82%. Getting pulled over and handed a ticket more than once, means that person is now considered a high risk driver. High risk drivers have increased insurance or in extreme cases no insurance at all. If the insurance bill increases to be too high and that person cannot afford to pay it off, then the insurance company will sometimes repossess the car.

Any type of cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous and quite irresponsible.

Restricting cell phones to a higher degree would have many benefits. While plugging in a phone to listen to music is acceptable as long as the phone is not touched afterwards, texting someone back when it is not urgent or checking Snapchat, is not worth taking an innocent life. It is also not worth the driver's life. Car accidents and wrecks will happen to everyone, everywhere regardless of cell phone use or not. There are many other things that can distract drivers. However, not all of those things can be restricted but cell phones can. The rule needs to be enforced more. Once that happens, while wrecks will still happen, it will greatly lower the risk of more people getting hurt because their cell phone controls them and their actions.",1
"Thousands of accidents happen in one year. Most of the causes of the accidents come from being cellphone which make you distracted. That one text you send can change your whole life in one second. That one phone call or that one text message is not worth your life. Drivers should be cautious when they are on the road, the road is very dangerous. The only reason that you should be on your phone is to look at GPS, anything that is not an emergency should not be important. Therefore, that mean the phone is not no where near more important than your life.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in your driving skills. The minute you look down at your phone is the minute your life can be taken away. You should have an hoaster in your car for your phone so that it won't in your hands. The phone should never be in your hands while you are driving the car. The road is too dangerous to not be focus on the road. You should an 100% focus on the road at all time. The only time that you should be on your phone is for the GPS or if it is very important. Your life is way more important than being on the phone, scrolling on social media, or sending a text. Why do you think in Georgia the cops are enforcing that you must have a phone hoaster to use your phone. It is getting serious from all these accidents from the drivers been distracted on the road.

"Phones and Driving

Knowing how society is today and knowing how technology plays a major role in some people's lives, I believe that people should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. The people in this society are so addicted to their cellphones, it can be super dangerous to be using them while driving. The more time people use their cellphones while driving, the less aware they will be of their surroundings on the roads, which can typically lead to more accidents. Drivers should always stay focused on the road and nothing but the road. Here are some reasons why.

One of the main reasons why you should not use a cell phone while driving is to be able to focus more on where you are going and your surroundings. The use of a cell phone can get you distracted, which could lead to you getting lost or it could lead to a fatal car accident. It is very dangerous to be distracted while you are driving. The quickest few seconds you take just to look at your phone can be risking the lives of others and yourself. To prevent that from happening, you should keep your phone on silent so it would not be a distraction to you.

Another reason why you should not be on your phone while driving is because of the safety of others. When you are driving with other people in the car, you should always consider their safety, as well as yours. Once you start distracting yourself from the road, you are putting the other passengers lives in danger. Not only should you consider the safety of your passengers, but you should also consider the safety of the people on the same road as you. You have to be cautious of the pedestrians and the other drivers on the road.

Most of the states are making it illegal to text and drive. States are making this an illegal law because of the amount of deaths caused by texting and driving. Making texting and driving illegal will help decrease the number of deaths from this cause. Getting caught texting and driving can result in getting fined.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why you should never text and drive. It is the most dangerous thing to do while driving. Even though it is very dangerous to be on your phone while driving, there are many alternatives. Instead of driving, you can pull over to the side of the road and respond to your message. Another solution is to give your phone to the passenger in the passenger's seat so they can respond to any messages. The most safest solution is to turn it off and put it in the middle console of your car, that way, you wouldn't be tempted to even look at it. That is why I believe people should not text and drive.",1
"Cell phones are a big issue while driving. Lots of accidents have happened in the past because of people being on their cell phones while driving. The main people that do text or play on their phones while driving are teenagers. There are many ways of solving this problem, but I am only going to be talking about one way to solve it.

One way that we can solve this problem is we can put blue tooth radios in our cars so that if someone calls you there would be a way to answer your phone without picking it up. Most of the newer cars have a Bluetooth radio in them so you don't have to buy one. Although older model cars don't have them you can buy them and install them. Over half of the accidents in the us happen because of people being or checking their phones.

Although it is never okay to use your phone while driving I think that if you solved that problem by getting a radio. If you have a Bluetooth radio, then there should be less of a chance of you getting in an accident because you would be on your phone less. Even though that is a solution you should still never touch you phone while operating a vehicle.",1

Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6million crashes each year. 1 of every 4 cars accidents are caused by using a cell phone while operating the motor vehicle.

What makes it worse is that nowadays we have tools and function built into our phones so we don't have to have them in our hands to use them. We now have bluetooth headphones so that we can answer calls without using our hands. We also now have handsfree modes that are built into our phones. Nowadays we really have no excuse to be hands on with our phones. There are a multitude of ways we can use them so we don't end up getting ourselves hurt in the process.

In all, choosing to text and drive or to not text and drive is purely a personal safety choice. Texting/Calling and driving while have the phone in your hand will forever be dangerous.

On a daily basis the majority of humans own and utilize cell phones. The use of a cell phone while driving can lead to injuring yourself; injuring others on the road; and having a record in the system. Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones while driving a vehicle.

Drivers are risking their lives when they decide to utilize their cell phones while driving. The cell phone is a form of distraction that can cause an accident. An article points out ""Failing to keep a proper lookout and to pay attention to surrounding dangers because of distractions caused by the cell phone"" (Warner and Sherman para. 4). Giving your phone a quick glance can result in an accident. Therefore, it's important to always keep your eyes on the road while driving.

People are not only risking themselves but others on the road as well; when they decide to use their cell phones. Talking or texting while driving is life threatening; that being the case it's essential not to try to multitask while driving a vehicle. When a driver is not being continuously attentive while driving; it can cause an accident. If they crash into another car; they're putting others life in danger. People need to be considerate of the other drivers on the road; so they need to be focused on their surroundings when driving.

Although, no state bans all cell phone use for all drivers. If you were to get in an accident because you were using a cell phone there would be consequences to the one at fault. If an accident were to occur you're more likely to face jail time; especially if it resulted in the other driver getting injured. Being in this situation can result in having a record in the system. A way to avoid this from occurring you would have to consider to put your cell phone on 'Do not disturb'.

At the end of the day it's a choice to decide whether or not you're going to utilize a cell phone while driving. Humans need to be cautious because their actions can affect others immensely. No one would want to live knowing they caused great pain to one's family; especially if they were to be the ones' who caused the accident because of driving with a cell phone. Drivers should avoid using a cell phone while driving a vehicle because of the dangers.",1
"Cell Phones and Driving

In today's society, the world depends on technology for nearly everything. It's used to communicate, do research, play games and even to give us directions when we are driving and lost. Everywhere you look you are likely to see technology in use, with one of the most popular devices being cellphones. This is easy to explain, as stated above, they are used for communication, access to internet, games and more. However, there are some instances when cell phones are a threat to our safety. Though cell phones are useful in some capacity, in most scenarios people should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving.

To begin, one of the main issues with cell phones like many other technology devices, cell phones are a distraction when you need to focus on the environment around you. While driving, the most important rule is to be completely attentive to your environment. Others may argue that people are able to multitask and can still focus on the road while using a phone.

Though this may have some truth, the problem comes when the cell phone distracts your attention from something that has happened on the road and/ or affects your reaction time. For example, image you are driving while texting a friend and you look up and notice a car swerving into your lane. With only one hand on the will you try to move over to avoid the car, but without full control of the wheel you end up turning too far and crashing into the another car. Even if you were able to drop your phone and put both hands on the wheel, by that time the car has already crashed into you. In this situation, an accident could have been avoided if you had been paying attention and acted quickly before the car came to close. Driving is already dangerous enough as something could go wrong in a matter of seconds, using a cell phone at the same time would only make it even more difficult in most cases.

In addition, despite popular beliefs, most people don't do well when trying to multitask. For driving, this means that if you are on your phone you are paying attention to the phone and not the road, even if it is just for a few seconds. But what could happen in a few seconds, some may ask? For example, you are driving to a friend's house through a populated neighborhood. You see that the street is all clear and take this chance to text your friend and tell them that you are close. At that exact moment at child runs into the street chasing a ball they had been playing with. By the time you look up it is too late to stop and you end up hitting the child. This accident could have been avoided if you had been paying one-hundred percent attention to the road. Even in situations when the problem is not another driver or pedestrian, there are still many things you should be paying attention to on the road. For instance, image the same example as above except there is no child in the road. The street is clear and you pull out your phone to text. At that moment you notice a pothole and swerve to avoid it and end up running over the sidewalk and straight into a tree. Yet again, this accident could have been avoided if you had been focusing on the road.

Although in most situations, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, there are two scenarios which when it may be need. The first situation is when the driver is lost and needs directions. In this situation, using the phone for directions is necessary, however this should be done in a certain way. When this is the situation the driver should use some type of hands free device to hold the phone so that they can keep both hands on the wheel at all times. The other scenario is in case of emergency. For example, you are driving on the highway and see a bad accident occur but you are unable to stop and do anything. In this situation it is appropriate to use your phone to call the police so that they can get there as soon as possible to help anyone who may have been injured in the accident. Outside of incidents such as these drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity.

To summarize, with the exception of being lost or in case of emergency, drivers should not be able to use cell phone while on the road as it not only puts themselves in danger, but those around them as well. In today's society, there have been countless accidents as a result of texting and driving. When you learn how to drive, the first thing you do is put on your seatbelt, why?

Because safety is the highest priority. If drivers are allowed to freely use their phones when on the road, that means that safety is no longer the highest priority and countless lives would be put at risk of injury and even death. If a text message, call, game or anything else is that important it will still be there for you to respond to after you have gotten to your destination safely.",1
"Texting and driving has become more of a problem as time goes on. With the large growth of technology use, almost everyone has access to a phone while driving. There are many reasons you should choose not to be on your phone while driving. Not only is it extremely dangerous for yourself but also anyone else on the road. It's something that should be taken very seriously. You should not be able to use a cell phone in any way while operating a vehicle, and if caught should result in punishment.

Texting and driving is a huge problem in day to day life. As people get too comfortable driving the more it starts to happen. People think they can get away with it which isn't always the case. Driving a vehicle is something that might seem easy if you have been driving for a long time, but is still a very dangerous task. It's something that requires your undivided attention no matter how long you've been doing it. Not only are you putting yourself at risk of harm but also everyone else on the road.

The National Safety Council says that using a phone while driving results in 1.6 million crashes each year. With 390,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. 1 out of 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. This is even more dangerous than being under the influence of alcohol when driving. There are punishments in place to help prevent people from doing this.

Laws on texting and driving vary by state. In Georgia if you are caught you're faced with a $50 fine with a point on your license for first offense. $100 for the second time and two points. $150 for the third time and 3 points. This can lead to your license being suspended if you have accumulated 15 points (4 if under the age of 21). These are just the lesser punishments, if you get in a wreck while on your phone it can become much worse with up to a year in jail time.

With these consequences and taking the risk of putting yourself and other people in harm's way isn't worth being on your phone. It's better to just wait until you're not driving. And as this issue continues to rise more and more it's important to be careful and watch out for other people that might be distracted on their phone while driving.",1
"Using your Phone and Driving

As people may know that driving and using your phone isn't safe and you may get pulled over by a police officer it seems like Americans doesn't care to use the phone while driving it's a huge Sacrifice to make. The people that breaks the law will never understand why it's important to not Text back or answer a phone call while driving until they get into a car accident themselves. There so confident in there driving skills they don't care about the risk there putting themselves and other Drivers into.

Everyone knows not to text in drive or use your phone at all while on the road because it's a high risk of an accident. That doesn't seem to effect peoples prospective on it. It seems as if people would die just to give one text like a text is more important then their life. in today's life Americans don't realize how addicted they are to their phones. they show this by taking a high risk to use their phone and drive on the road.

When you're driving you should always be careful also make sure to always watch what's going on around you because someone else could be using their phone while

On the road as well. The main reason people get in a car accident while on their phone

Is because they are not paying attention to anything so they could exceed the speed limit or takes their eyes off the road. If you need to use your phone you could pull over

But that's not an option for most people because they are always in a hurry.

Most people believe that they are ok or doesn't affect them when they us their phone and drive and they over estimate their driving ability and that's what leads to a car accident that may cost you your life. when a person hits someone the first thing the

Person in the wrong would say is ""I never saw him/she ""or ""He came out of nowhere"".

It's hard to understand how you didn't see anyone while driving because you were on your phone when your eyes should be on the road.

Therefore, people don't understand not to drive and use your phone but somehow

They still proceed to use them like they don't care. To live like the text is more important than your life. to many people have died from car accident all because a phone is addicting to use or over estimate of their driving skills. Drivers are too addicted to their phones they're not aware of or noticed of their surroundings.",1
"Should drivers be allowed to use their phones while driving?

Every year, there are 1.6 million car crashes due to cell phone use while driving. (https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html) One out of every four crashes is, all in all, caused by somebody being so distracted and sucked in by their phone. When are people going to realize that using any kind of cellular device while driving is a distraction so dangerous, it could cost others their lives, as well as their own? Is sending that one text really worth dying over? People need to see the dangers of using cell phones while driving. It has become such a giant problem, and it needs to be stopped. Drivers should be prohibited from handling or looking at their phones while driving.

Teens are the most likely case of texting and driving. Nowadays, teens feel the need to always have their eyes glued to their phone screen. Who can blame them? Social media and texting are some of the main methods of communication in 2018. On the contrary, teens are irresponsible and choose to catch up with their friends online at the wrong time. On top of being inexperienced drivers, they are constantly taking their eyes off the road to check their cell phone. Teens especially should be taught the dangers of using phones while driving; how one text can change not only your life, but everybody else's around you.

Everybody has been late to work, school, or anything else at some point in their lives. They are rushing and they go out the door, driving a little faster than they normally would, trying to get to their destination on time. Now, add a phone to this situation. According to the Edgar Snyder law firm, texting while driving has a ""400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road."" (https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html) Alongside being in a hurry, the person who is late to work is now endangering themselves and others.

What if, maybe, the person driving was not the culprit of using phones while driving? Already in a rush, they are trying to get to work on time, and they are struck by a careless driver, who was changing the song they were listening to on their phone.

Every year, with the advance in use of technology, there are more and more accidents involving phones. ""In 2015, 391,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers."" Of those people, 3,477 died. That may seem like a small chunk, but those are lives that did not need to be lost. Simply putting your phone down and waiting could have saved somebody. In schools, there needs to be an organized plan to teach kids about these kinds of dangers. This needs to happen soon, especially for high schoolers, who are at the age where they are learning to drive, and also the most involved in technology and their phones.

To conclude, drivers, no matter the age or experience, should not be able to use their phones at all while driving. There have been too many countless deaths and injuries related to phones and driving. This can be prevented by implementing a system in schools to teach about the dangers of phone use while driving. There should also be a course in Drivers Education, whether online or in schools, strictly on phone use. Any person of any age should be able to learn the dangers of texting, changing music, taking pictures, etc. while behind the wheel.

"In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving are just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion, I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours, an average of 660,000 people is using electronic devices while driving.

When you text and drive you to put not only your life at risk but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.

Texting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing death. When you text and drive you are distracted and not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving are bad and also illegal.

Additionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also, you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.

In conclusion, texting and driving do not need to occur. Don't do anything else in your car, only watch the road and both of your hands on the wheel. People need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in too. Would you rather die on the road texting I am going to be there or actually make it?",1

"Texting or using your cell phone while driving are dangerous. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use phone while operating a vehicle. According to research cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of danger or causing an accident people still text and drive because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Cell phones are good in emergency situations but not while you driving. Although people support using cell phones while driving. That is dangerous and they should avoid talking while driving.

However, because of their habits they can create dangerous and hazardous problem like a collision or an accident. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phone while driving they can harm innocent people. Instead of your eyes locking or glancing at your phone they should be lock on watching their speed and the road.

Texting while driving is a big issue and we doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and putting the others people who on the road lives in dangerous. Leave the phone hands-free while you driving, a text is not worth your life that text still will be there whenever you reach your destination.",1
"In today's society, phones are a big distraction. When someone's phone makes a sound or when someone gets a notification, that person just has to check it. Even though we all know being on the phone and driving is extremely dangerous. People should not physically use their phones while they're driving.

Using your phone and driving doesn't only put the driver in danger, but the passengers as well. A life should be way more important than a text message or notification. A person could look away for a split second and a crash could happen right in that moment. When someone is on their phone and driving they're very much capable of drifting off. Just a minor slip up could turn into a major accident.

If an accident was to occur due to someone being on their phone while driving, that person is more than likely going to be the one responsible. Distracted driving has become more normal in today's society. Most people often use their phones while driving because they feel capable of doing so. That same reason could be a cause of a death due to an accident. It would be much easier to avoid accidents if everyone started off their phones while driving.

Taking your eyes off of the road for two seconds increases your risk of crashing. People feel as if they're experienced drivers and that they know what they're doing. That's what's using their phones while driving comes into place. They might just be experienced but those around them may not be. Those around them just might crash because they were the one in their phone.

Being a distracted driver not only affects the victims but those who love them. They can prevent deaths by just putting their phones up while driving. A notification or text message can wait until the car isn't in motion. Being impatient can cause someone to lose their life because of an irresponsible driver. Phone shouldn't be used while driving.",1
"Hang Up the Phone or Hang Up Your Life

In today's modern era, people's use and dependency on technology has drastically increased. According to the Pew Research Center, an estimated five billion cell phone owners exist around the world as of the year 2019 (Silver). Phones, specifically, have combined the use of regular land-line telephones, global positioning systems, and internet access into a small neat package. The list of benefits from such devices seems almost infinite however not many are able to recognize some serious repercussions.

In the year 2017, it was reported that there were a total of 3,166 deaths due to distracted driving (Currin). The United States Department of Transportation (USDT) declared the average time spent looking at a phone while driving is around five (5) seconds. USDT further states, ""At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed.""

Sergeant Clayton Richardson details in, ""Distracted Driving and the Police Officer,"" how states are actively putting sanctions in place against the use of cell phones on the roads. 21 states, including Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, have put sanctions against distracted driving in relation to cell phone usage.

While there may be pressing reasons for drivers to be on their cell phones however no reason is more important than the lives of drivers, passengers and pedestrians as well.

Phones have been around for almost 5 decades. Phones have been a social outlet for years but once you start talking you lose concentration. Driving takes a lot of focus because when you dont focus you can harm a lot of people. When u merge texting or calling with driving it's more than likely a deadly situation. Driving is dangerous but most people multitask while doing it.. I believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving.(The First Mobile Phone Call)

Phones have been around for years and most people can't live without them. Studies show that ""The average American spends more than 3 hours on a smartphone per day"". The average person checks their phone 52 times a day . We spend most of our free time on our phones when in reality there is so much going on in the world but we don't even notice. Phones are a real big help in today's world but it also very dangerous. We are so addicted that even babies have phones. kids don't go outside and play anymore or climb trees and ride bikes or even catch lightning bugs. kids would rather sit in the house and be on their phones or playing games or watching tv. Most people today can't go 30 mins without their phone.(Straight Talk Blog)&(Smartphone Addiction)

Driving is something we can't stop but we can stop careless people from killing others by being on their phone. We should pass a law to take people to jail for being on their phone while driving. It's too dangerous for them to only get a ticket. It happens so often that""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving"".

She was pronounced dead at the scene""...(TextingnDriving. com) If she would've followed the law she would've made it to school happily and still have her life.

There are so many more accidents of people losing their lives to texting and driving. ""Chelsea Ann bragg, 16, was killed in a rollover crash after texting while driving, She veered off the shoulder of the road and then lost control of the car...""(TextingnDriving. com) This example also shows not only are you putting your life in jeopardy you are also putting other people lives in the vehicle in jeopardy. ""Ashley D. Miller, 18, veered into oncoming traffic and hit another car head-on while she was texting. She and the other driver, a 40 year old mother of 1, were killed instantly""...(textingndriving. com) If she was watching the road like she was supposed to be that child would still have their mother.

All of these examples prove that you should not text while driving because it could change so many people lives in so many different ways then they could possibly imagine, this is the reason why so many states uphold this law to the fullest because so many people lose their lives from texting and driving.",1
"Today's society highly revolves around internet use and it can get to a point where people are using it everywhere and anytime they want. Using it while driving can be extremely dangerous therefore i highly disagree that phones can be used while driving because not only are you putting yourself at risk but you are putting other people's life at risk as well. One error can lead to anyone's death and putting yourself at major risk. That's some reasons why i disagree that we should text and drive.

People are putting a lot at risk by texting while driving because your not gonna be as focused on the road as if your texting on the phone. Doing that can highly put risk a lot of people's life due to the fact of your reaction time is minimized. Say your driving on the freeway 60 mph and your on the phone your gonna be 50% on the road and 50% on the phone. Doing that puts so much risk and could potentially end someone's life.

Death can be something that can happen if your texting and driving because not being focused can always lead to worst scenarios. There are model predicting that text messaging are involved in 6-16% of all car accidents in the US. With that being said there's a chance an accident happening and that's very dangerous. People just need to put there phones down and focus more on the road before it potentially ends bad for them.

Some ways of preventing this would be to tell family, friends and organizations to which you belong about the importance of driving without distractions. Also Take information to your kids' schools and ask that it be shared with students and parents. Doing this will be so much awareness and can help so much when texting and driving and safe many lives. No one should text and drive and if you need to text or talk on the phone, pull over to a safe place. Set rules for yourself and help someone out !

With that being said there are ways of preventing an accident and helping out lives. I disagree with driving with phones because it can cause many life changes and that is very painful. Putting your phone to the side is safer than keeping it with you non stop. Therefore in my opinion there should be a law or ban of any types of phones in a car.",1
"Phones and Driving

Today, the majority of people own and operate their phones while driving their vehicles which will always be a no go. That's very dangerous and now it is illegal to do so, if you are caught texting and driving or even talking on the phone while you are driving you will get pulled over and maybe sent to jail.

I feel like the only time you should talk on the phone and drive is if its an emergency with your kids, mom, husband, or dad. You probably shouldn't then but i know i would because i would want to know what's going on with either of them.

Texting and driving causes many wrecks, and kills hundreds of people each year. And it's all over a simple little text you could have read after you got to a stopping point or could have even waited until you got home. I risk my life every day just like any other person just by texting and driving and the text dont even be that important but to me it is. Over 50% of crashes are because of people who text and drive. When you are engaged in a conversation from calling or even texting your attention is divided causing you to hit something or someone and who's to say you will make it out of that?

There are so many ways texting and driving can be permitted, even if you have to leave your phone at home just to run to walmart do it!! Because no phone is worth losing your life over i promise it's more to that. A simple ""ok"" text could lead into you getting in a wreck being left in critical condition with doctors telling your family ""you might not make it"" do you want that to happen? Think about texting and driving before you do it, it's never the answer it can wait.",1
"On the contrary car crashes due to cell phone use goes up each year. People lose their lives daily by trying to do something that may be so simple to them. Maybe trying to change a song, text someone back, take a picture, etc. People do not realize that anything can happen in the blink of an eye. Just like that loved one of yours could be dead or severely injured. You should never be on the phone by any means while driving.

For this reason, I think you should always be hands-free while driving no matter what.

Think about ""Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 metres per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you.""You being on your phone while driving you put your life potentially at risk and other drivers. Causing us to have accidents that could have been avoided but now is a serious problem because someone may be hurt. A text message or skipping a song is worth more than your life or someones else. Therefore will driving always keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.

In addition, being on the phone while driving causes a two-second distraction. Increasing the chances of you being in a car crash. For instance, ""mobile phone use while driving increases your risk of accident by up to 400 per cent, points out that, in 2016 alone, police in NSW charged 39,000 people for doing so (100 drivers a day are busted for it in NSW and VIC)."" Just put your phones down and focus on the road. You don't want to be the person who may have killed someone loved one. You never know at the time if it may be more then one person was in the car at the time of the accident and someone may have gotten injured. Now you have to take responsibility in that situation when it all could have been avoided if you have chosen not to use your phone while driving.

Generally speaking, everyone knows right from wrong. Doing anything, in general, that may distract you even in less of a second is just something you shouldn't do. Innocent people have been killed or severely injured due to these kinds of things. Now someone may have just taken their last breath of fresh air, someone may have taken their last steps and is now paralyzed. This has been something that has been a problem for a while and should have been put a stop to it.

In the end, we all make our own decisions but deep down we know which one is right. No one wants to live with that guilt in their mind for the rest of their life knowing they were the reason someone's family or friend passed away. Don't be the reason, be the person who does the right thing and making it safer on the road for people.

"Driving and Phones

Phones and driving have been a big problem and continue to be a big problem. Just one careless person looking down to read a text could result in multiple deaths. People don't fully grasp the reality of the danger that is really there, people think that oh it would never happen to them or that they're too good a driver for them to hit someone. But just looking down at your phone could end things for you and others.

Could be someone walking, another car, a child, an animal, anything. When you take your yes off the road then it distracts you from your surroundings, from where you're going, from whats infront of you.

There are already laws in place to try and stop people from being on their phones while behind the wheel, but some people just don't care and some people think that they could just never hit someone or something. Cell phones should not be a priority while driving, you are trying to get from point A to point B. You should be able to wait till you are out of the car to answer a text or check social media. If it is urgent then simply pull over as soon as you can and get to it. But you should never be on your phone behind the wheel.

There has been many deaths related to cell phones and driving and with people becoming more and more addicted and attached to their phones and social media its harder and harder to get people off their phones. People are so attached that they are on their phones all the time not caring where they are.

I believe we should have harsher punishments and better ways to detect people on their phone. Maybe a harsher punishment for just being seen holding it behind the wheel will make some people think twice.",1
"Hands Free Law

Losing the privilege to drive can be upsetting, all the work that's put in just to get the privilege to drive. Driving is a privilege that we earn and lose, this essay discusses the ways to lose and keep the privilege to drive. There are multiple ways to lose the privilege of driving but one way is by using a electronic device while behind the wheel. Most people believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones,texting,etc. while operating a vehicle.

Driving while talking on the phone can get others and the driver hurt. One example could be hydroplaning. Hydroplaning is caused by traction and sliding on a film of water. Using one hand for driving and the other hand for the phone while it's raining is a creation of an accident and getting the privilege to drive taken away. Your driving privileges would be taken away because the driver has a phone in their hand and it's not allowed to have a phone in the vision of the driver behind the wheel.

Another example would be of course texting and driving because once again there is a phone in the hand of the driver instead of both hands on the wheel and no one paying attention to the road. This could lead to an accident because many drivers don't know where they're going and the car could lose control. Driving with a device in your hand is a distraction because your attention should be focusing on your surroundings and the vehicles on the road.

To keep from getting hurt and jeopardizing your life and the life of others,drivers should follow the Hands Free Law. The Hands Free Law is a proposed driving law that states that a driver shall not ""record or broadcast a video"" on any mobile phones, iPads, computers or touching any part of their bodies while operating a vehicle. Even with the Hands Free technology, drivers are not allowed to write, read, or send any messages or emails, but voice to text is allowed. Voice to text is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output or when the speaker can speak into their device and it translates their words into a text so that the speaker is able to answer the text message or any other important subject.

Driving is a privilege. Responsible drivers should always pay attention to the road and other drivers. Cell phones should always be out of the drivers hand so they may maneuver the steering wheel and not drive reckless. Drivers need to remember that driving is a privilege and that it can easily be taken away from you.",1
"Texting and Driving is Dangerous

Many people use cellphones on a daily basis while driving a car. This is a common practice for some teenagers and is a form of distracted driving known as ""Texting and Driving."" In many states it is illegal to text and drive. There have been laws adopted in many states to prevent people from texting and driving while in a vehicle. Even though people do it, drivers should not be able to use cellphones in any compacity while operating a vehicle because it takes their eyes away from the road. The use of a cellphone while driving is very dangerous, careless, and cause crashes that hurt and kill people.

Additionally, when driving a car, the driver should be alert and paying attention to their surroundings. The driver should not be dialing, sending a text, or reading Facebook because it stops the driver's concentration from the road. Texting while driving is the cause of more than 58% of crashes involving teen drivers. Life is more important than ""I'm close or an OMG"" text! It takes five seconds to send a text and five seconds to be the cause of a crash, that can hurt or endanger the lives of other people. The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting and driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Furthermore, in Georgia, laws have been made prohibiting the use of cellphones while driving a vehicle. It is illegal to hold a cellphone in your hand or on any part of your body and if violators get caught, you will have to pay a large fine. The law should be enough to stop people from driving and using their cellphones, but it's not. On the news, in Cobb County, the police dresses up as utility workers at various intersections to catch violators using their phones and most of the time they catch a lot of drivers and give out traffic citations.

In conclusion, no one should be on their phone while driving because it is a risk to them and other drivers on the road. Cellphones are a wonderful invention and one of the greatest inventions made by man, but texting while driving is very dangerous and can cause death to other drivers. This can also result into being convicted of murder and life in prison.

"The prompt is talking about if people are able or unable to use their cell phone while they are driving or when they are at a stop light or stop sign. I think people shouldn't be able to use their cell phone, the reason why is because most of the time car crashes happened when people are using their cell phone but, I think people are able to use their cell phone when they are at a stop light. When people are using their cell phones that what causes a car crash. The way people get in a car crash is when they driving and looking at the cell phone to text people back they look away for a good amount of second that a car can switch to their line and because the person on their cell phone they would see in till it is to late. people shouldn't use their cell phone because most death are because or the cell phone. But at a stop light I think people are able to look at their cell phone and use it because you are not moving or anything you are just in one spot, so you won't hit anything and you do got time to use their cell phone because the light takes forever to change to green. So to me I disagree that using your cell phone while driving should be a no go because that's how much of the people get a ticket or get into a car crash that sometimes they get hurt or they hurt others so that's why it think driving while using your phone should be banned. But I agree that if you are at a stop light you are able to use your for because you are in one places you are not moving at all and also the light takes time to change so you can go that why I agree that it is the only time to see who texted you and text back.",1

The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle should not be allowed. Today in society people do not realize how much cellphones have affected the way people drive. It is and it has been a danger for a while now. There are many dangers due to the use of cell phones most people do not realize that they really are.

To begin with, the majority of car accidents that happen everyday are usually caused by people who are using their cell phones while driving. They tend to use their cell phone while being on the road thinking they can multitask when in reality they can't. People do not realize the kind of accident they can cause by replying back to a text or just reading one. That one simple reply can take someone else's life in a blink of an eye. Once it happens there is no going back, it's not like a message where you can delete or go back to that one specific text.

In fact, using your cell phone is a bad choice to do while driving on the road. There are people with kids in their car trying to get back home or on their way to spend time with some family. Most of these people do not make it back home or to their destination due to either a car accident caused by people who are distracted on their phone. There are children who do not know that a simple phone they use to watch videos on is a bad thing for them. Not only is it a bad thing but it can cause serious outcomes to anybody who is just driving and going on with their life.

To tell the truth, the use of cellphones while driving is illegal in most places. People can get a ticket and get fined for doing so. There are many penalties that people can receive from getting a ticket. For example, some may pay the fine and get demerit points to your license. These demerit points provide a balance and check anyone's driving; they are either added or subtracted from your license. These point vary based on the type of convictions you get. If you go over the number of demerit points based on the type of license you have your license may be suspended. People need to know that you will get a consequence for using your cellphone while driving. It may not seem like a big deal but in the real life it is.

As a final point, the use of any type of cell phone should not be allowed by anyone who is driving. No one really knows the kind of danger cell phones be putting people in. Yes it's a small device almost as big as the size of your hand but it can cause a serious accident. Cell phones may not seem like a big deal to people nowadays but in reality they can be deadly.",1

Do you think it is worth it to look at your phone while driving? The zebra conducted a national survey of young drivers to determine their perception of texting and driving. 36% of respondents aged 18-24 admitted to texting while driving. Using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should never be done.

One reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you could put yourself at risk of injuring yourself or someone else. Say your driving and you hear your phone's notifications going off you feel the urge to pick up your phone just to see what it is out of curiosity and you Know you shouldn't pick up your phone because you are driving but you still pick it up anyway. That one moment you look up to see a person crossing the street and are lucky enough to press your foot on the brakes in time to stop in the intersection. Consider yourself lucky as you could've injured that person. Things like this can happen which is why you should be more careful when driving.

Second reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you should consider who your riding with whether it be a friend or group of friends or maybe family members you wouldn't want to risk their lives and yours only because you grabbed your phone to look at for a few seconds. You should think twice before reaching for that phone and think about what you do. If they say don't use your phone listen to them and don't think about it focus your eyes on the road. It is not worth all the trouble.

Finally, the third reason you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is it is probably illegal. Almost all the states including some without cellphone prohibit text messaging while driving. In most of these states, you can be pulled over and cited for texting as a primary offense. When on the road be careful what you do and don't think about grabbing your phone even if it's just for a few seconds.

Overall, you should never use your phone while operating a vehicle because it is very dangerous. Remember you could risk injuring yourself or someone else. Consider who your driving with and it is probably illegal depending on the situation.

"Phones and Driving

When we think of cell phones we think of a device that we can't live without. A cell phone is something so essential to our lives that when we use them we tune everything else out. We constantly stay on our cellphones to distract us from the problems that are happening in the real world. We use our phones everywhere we go but we never watch our surroundings. When driving it is important to know your surrounding but when you're distracted by messages and phone calls and social media it puts the passengers and your life at risk

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at four times greater risk of a crash. Despite a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hands-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary for emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Yes, people should enjoy their rights to talk, text, snap, and all the uses of their phones just not while they're in their car. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase.",1

Imagine that you are driving and you get a text from someone and you feel that you just had to answer. Then you respond and when you look up your unable to stop in time and then everything goes black. This whole situation could have been avoided if being on your phone was not as important as your well being and others. Although it may be convenient to text while driving, it is increasingly becoming the reasons for car accidents today. Texting while driving in any situation while operating a vehicle should not be used.

Texting while driving is causing you to not have at least one of your hands off of the wheel. Looking down at your phone will make you react to anything that may occur slower. Someone who is attentive is able to react to a possible accident occurring whilst the person texting and driving would not. This is known as defensive driving when one is able to defend yourself against dangers on the road. One who is using their device while driving lacks defensive driving.

Using your mobile device while operating a vehicle is said to be ""approximately 18% of all fatal crashes are caused by texting and driving"", according to drive-safely. net. Within the year of 2012 itself, 3,328 people were killed because of texting and driving; while around 420,000 were injured. Also, a poll taken in the United States showed that 40% of teen drivers had admitted that they text and drive. These numbers have went up five times as much as they were.

Most people do not know this or choose to ignore it but texting while driving is illegal. Many states either have specific or various laws about texting while driving. If there was an accident to occur and and authorities find out it is due to texting and driving then you will end up facing a judge. For example, if you were texting and driving and you were to distracted on your phone to see a pedestrian then you could be charged murder.

People tend to text and drive without realizing that it may cost their life or someone else's. A text is never that important that could possibly change your life for the worse. It may be considered cool or easier to just be on your phone whenever you want, but it is the increasing reasoning for car accidents. Texting and driving is illegal for a reason and that should be a very serious law to abide by. Before you decide to pick up your phone while your driving just ask yourself: Is this really worth putting myself or others at risk?

"Phones & Driving

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. A lot of things in the 21st century have to do with using a cell phone, including driving. Although some people may agree with using a cell phone while driving, others may disagree. They all have their own reasons why, but I'm going to explain why drivers should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

There are lots of benefits when using a cell phone while operating a vehicle, but the most important benefit of cell phones during driving is the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and the driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route or find his/her way back home if they are lost. Using FMs on cell phones can also provide information about weather and traffic.

Regulating cell phone use is not a federal responsibility, even on federal roads. This is not an issue that Washington has the authority to address. There's no compelling reason for it. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that 3,092 traffic deaths last year involved distracted drivers. But using a cell phone is only one of many driver distractions. Eating and drinking while behind the wheel are two others, and they are far more dangerous than yapping on the phone. In fact, a 2009 NHTSA study found that 80% of all car wrecks are caused by drivers eating or drinking, not cellphone use, with coffee-guzzling the top offender.

According to federal data, traffic deaths have fallen from 2.1 per 100 million vehicle miles in 1990, when virtually no one had a cellphone, to 1.1 in 2009, when almost everyone does. We have no problem with bans on texting while in the driver's seat. Texting forces a driver's eyes off the road and is clearly risky. But it must be done at the state level. That's how federalism works. States that don't see texting as a threat on their roads are free to keep it legal.

But banning cellphone use? Why aren't the Potomac nannies going after Starbucks sippers and Big Mac munchers instead? Why not prosecute women who put on their makeup while on the road and men who shave? Shouldn't combing while driving be outlawed as well? This is all coming, of course, from the same Washington that's commanding automakers to build more fuel-efficient cars, which is likely to result, as it has in the past, in more carnage as the cars have to be smaller and lighter to meet the standards. If federal meddlers really wanted to keep traffic fatalities down, they'd reverse their fuel-efficiency demands.

"People use their cell phones for just about everything. Citizens on the daily, use their phones for GPS, texting, calling, social media, etc.. There are pros and cons to using cell phones while driving, also depending how you use them. But if I had to choose in between the two, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle unless there's an emergency, and here's why.

Accidents happen every day and it is very rare at times, that people make it out alive. People are dying almost every day from car accidents because of cell phones. About 30 percent of accidents involve talking, texting on cell phones. That should send a message to people saying, "" Hey, stop texting and driving"". When you decide to use your phone and drive, you've basically just decided to put not just you, but someone else's life at risk.

Take consideration in your passengers, pedestrians, and other people's operating a vehicle life. It does not take long to pull over or park your car to take care of whatever was so important that u had to put other lives in danger and pull your cell phone out. You need to really think about what's really important when your want to pull your phone out. And let's not just skip over the fact that is illegal. Being pulled over or caught on your phone while driving can affect you, negatively.

With driving and using your phone being against the law, if you are caught, you will get an automatic fixed penalty notice, three penalty points, and a fine. And if your license gets suspended and you continue to drive, it's an additional 6 months. So slow down and really ask yourself is this worth picking up the phone right away to text your boyfriend/girlfriend back. Is this really this time to call friends and make plans? I would say it's a lot to think about but it's not. Just do the right thing.

Imagine not making it back home to your loved ones. Imagine what you could cause and put other people through that they didn't deserve, because they were doing the right thing. Or put yourself in their shoes. Just think about it before you decide to pull your phone out and possibly cause accidents maybe death. We can prevent things happening like that if we just do the right thing. Is the cell phone worth it? That's a decision for you to make. But I would tell you, "" No, we as drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle"".",1

Drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle for these reasons. The first reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is to inform loved ones if the situation their in changes, they can do so if they have handsfree because if they do not have handsfree it is illegal especially in Georgia. The second reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is that it is nighttime, and they have trouble staying awake, so they call loved ones and have a conversation to help them stay awake, doing so with a handsfree. The third reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because drivers pay a lot of money to get handsfree. Not be allowed to use cell phones at all is like the government robbing them twice. Twice because once for the handsfree, and another for a ticket for using it. The fourth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because they might need to report a bad driver.

The fifth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones operating a vehicle is because they might listen to satellite radio on their phone instead of listening to FM radio. On their phone because it is better for their money to use it at home and outside of the car and when you are in the car instead of using the satellite radio source on the radio to connect their phone to Bluetooth and play satellite radio there. The sixth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because someone at your job may not know your on the road and try and call you and you need to answer it.

People driving while looking at their phones has become an epidemic and is a big cause of a lot of accident. Primarily involving teens who are so distracted by their phones that they are not paying any attention to the road. With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.

If you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger. Looking away from the road for even just 2 seconds can be the difference between life and death because one moment the roads might be clear and the next you could be rolled over trapped in your car.

When you are on your phone while driving, you are not only putting your life in danger but the lives of everyone around you on the road and possibly even pedestrians on the side of the roads. There are many deferent alternatives to being on your phone while driving, such as Bluetooth enabled devices that connect to the car so that you can still talk on the phone without using your hands. Another alternative is if you have a passenger, for them to read you the information and relay it back for you. That is just a few ways to avoid staying on your phone while driving",1

In my opinion, drivers shouldn't have access to cell phones while driving on the road.

The reason is that we have too many accidents, Insurance Rates & it's illegal. If you are texting and driving you are 23 times more to have a car crash. According to the stats, 49 percent of American Adults drivers admitted while driving. Over drinking and driving texting and driving has passed to number 1 on distractions for people while driving.

According to The National Safety Council reported that in the past year people there were 1.6 million crashes due to texting and driving. Also as I stated in my intro paragraph ""if you are texting and driving you are 23 more times more likely to have a car crash. 1 out of 4 car crash deals with on the phone while driving. In 2013 3,154 people died in car accidents due to texting and driving. In 2016 263 Teens (ages 15 to 19) were killed as a result of texting and driving.

Also if you text and drive your Car Insurance Rate will go up. Because of people texting while driving Insurance rates have gone up 20 percent since 2014. More and More Insurance companies are starting to track cell phone use for drivers they insure. Car Insurance premiums are determined by many different factors including where you live, your age and your driving history. Why does texting and driving impacts everyone? Because so many people do it car insurance companies have been raising their rates.

According to the law there is 46 States in the U.S. plus Washington D.C. , Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands has banned/Pementid drivers from texting while driving.

Thirty-Seven states in all have a cell phone ban. That means that any cell phone use by the driver while on the road is Prohibited. There are three states that have secondary enforcement which is Florida, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Which means officers need another reason to pull you over before they can issue a ticket for texting and driving.

In Conclusion, I think drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while driving on the road. It is too dangerous for drivers to be on their phones while driving. It causes accidents boosts up your Insurance Rates and plus it is illegal in most parts of the U.S. In my opinion it should be banned in all states that no driver should be able to do any cell phone use while driving. I've stated my opinion so what's yours?",1
"In the United States one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and about 1500 people are injured by these irresponsible people. Most of the time its because they are texting while driving. Technology has drastically increased. They seem to use their devices more than anything, which cause them to not want to put their phone down because they are afraid they might miss something. I feel like no matter what happens people might think they know how to pay attention. You still shouldn't do it because you never know what might happen one day.

People feel like they have to reply to a text message immediately , which leads to vehicular accidents that may result in death. The age group that are involved in these accidents is 16 year olds and up to 30. This should take a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person if you text while drive, it can cause your life or someone else's.

However, in 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes due to distracted drivers. For this reason, it is very important that we find a way to break the habit of texting and driving. If we don't stop this now the rate of accidents and deaths will quickly increase. Law enforcement have came out with a law when you can not have the phone in your hand , do this work? No, people still text and drive and end up injured or killed. Because of this we should put our phones down or turn them off if you can't keep your hands off it. A text or post can wait if it means it will save your life and someone else's.

Some people might say ""i can multi-task"" or ""i know what im doing"". Those that's saying these things are the main ones that in involved in accidents. No matter what you think you can do you should still always be safe. For example, say you are texting while driving and some one walks across the street and you look up to late then BOOM!, another accident. Always go the safe route and keep your phones put away to avoid these situations.

However, I strongly agree that texting and driving is very dangerous and I have the responsibility to put my phone down and focus on the rode. Texting and driving is the most dangerous thing on the rode today due to all of the technology we have. LIfe is more important then texting someone back , ask yourself this will they cause their life just to text you back fast?",1
"Should We or Should We Not Use Phones While Driving?

I personally belive that we shouldn't be active on a phone while driving. Driving while being active on a phone has caused 1.6million crashes each year. On the other hand nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents in the united states is caused by the phone usage. I tell my older siblings to not be on the phone while driving or not to text, you never know what might happen because 9 times out of 10 your interested in whats on the phone more than the road that your suppose to be focusing on. I know someone who actually past away from a wreck and there eyes where on the road so its a greater chance of wrecking when your eyes aren't on the road.

A lot of people don't belive in having to not use something they paid for at anytime until they experience a wreck or hurt someone els. Like why even risk losing your life because you wanted to be on the phone while driving. There are even ways to prevent crashing while talking on the phone like putting it on the bluetooth it's even been proven to be the best way to talk while driving.

The reason me myself and other people say bluetooth would be the best solution is because you won't have to fumble with the phone while talking and driving you would have it right in your ear. Bluetooths are wireless earphones which you don't have to have your phone in your hand. It could easily be a situation were your talking on the phone while it's in between your cheek and shoulder and it slip and you try to catch your phone and lose control driving that's why i prefer bluetooth.

Driving while talking can be done in a way but texting while driving is another thing. Texting while driving is dangerous because your eyes won't be a hundred percent focused on the road. I do not agree with texting while driving it's totally different from talking while driving. You will have to be hands on and looking at the phone in order to text. Meaning you while have one hand on the steering wheel and be looking back in forth from phone to road.",1
"Phones and Driving

People shouldn't use their phones while driving because now people are getting killed by people driving while using their phones. Over the years drivers haven,t been paying attention to the road ever since social media have been created.

So now Gwinnett County made a law so that drives can't use their phone to prevent death rate from increasing in the county. With today's technology cars will now allow you to call people through the car's bluetooth settings. And if we need a gps we can also input on the cars gps. Even though you can do all of this stuff now you still need to watch where you're going and the speed limit so you don't risk other people's lives because of how fast your driving.

Even today neighborhoods are have kids getting hit on the side of the road just because your not watch the road, but instead texting while your driving. I even watch people look at their phones even if nobody's around you can still injure you and the passengers in the vehicle. Done the street on my way to my uncle's house there's a sign with gifts all because someone was texting on their cell phones. And hit the car she was in and caused a wrecked leaving one dead and two injured all because that person was texting while he was driving.",1
"Texting while Driving

Texting while driving is so dangerous, that it replaced drinking and drinking to be more dangerous. Reasons why Texting while driving is dangerous can lead to death and permanent injuries to yourself and others, adults need to set an example and also its illegal . A big part of the problem is people are very confident that can safely text while driving, some even claim that it is easy to do the two at once. And here's why i believe these reasons are dangerous.

Texting and driving can lead to your death and loved ones. Distracted driving has become a dangerous practice on our streets and highways. In the United States, 3,328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone, while an estimated 421,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver according to distraction. gov. Aside from the statistics and number of deaths, think about if you want to be the one responsible for a close friend or family member death or injury because you didn't want to the phone down.

Another reason is adults need to set an example for the youth. Why wouldn't young drivers think it's okay to text and drive? They've seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents. Did you know forty-eight percent of young drivers have seen their parents drive while talking on the phone. This is where adults can help educate on the dangers of distracted driving

- by setting the example and taking the ""it can wait"" approach. There are also many different resources for parents to help educate their kids about distracted driving. From text-free-driving pledges to drive cams that monitor a driver's activity. A lot of people think it isn't that serious to enforce, but it is . Its very important to ensure the safety of our young.

Last but not least, texting while driving is illegal. Any form of text messaging while driving is illegal, and is considered a petty misdemeanor statewide. While the fine for texting while driving may only be $150.00, it also carries one point on your driving record, which may result in higher insurance premiums or possibly even cancellation of your policy. Fines up to

$500; or $1,000 if an accident results. Another question to ask yourself while reading this essay is, you would risk your privilege to drive to send a text when you can simply wait, or pull over, turn your vehicle off and then send your message. If one is not able to do this then being behind the wheel wouldn't be for them.

In conclusion is texting and driving can result to death, adults need to lead by example, and its against the law. texting and driving is a serious matter, and shouldn't be taken lightly. It's up to society to make the right decision and abide by the rules. As i said before if one feels these rules are bendable or not that serious they shouldn't be behind the wheel and consequences will come with your actions.",1
"Using Cellphone While Driving

Technology has brought us together and it is still developing for even more. We have electricity that fuels the car, we have cellphones that control TV's, and we have a computer that does things humans have hard time doing. When technologies combine, they make our lives easier; likewise, using a cellphone while driving is okay.

People may argue that using a cellphone while driving is dangerous but any technology, if used wrong, can be deadly to not only ourselves, but lives around us. Therefore, people should be able to use cellphone while driving, but in a manner that is reasonable. Using GPS (Global Positioning System), to guide your way or to listen to music is a good example of using cellphones safely.

Using a GPS system on your phone while driving helps us to get to our destination easier and lets us focus on the road better. If we did not have a GPS and we were to look for signs to go anywhere, we would be very much likely to get distracted or get tired quickly. Yes, it is true that we can replace our phone's GPS with a GPS device, but again, if the driver is not misusing cellphones, it is essentially getting the same job done. Also, because smartphones are easier to control and easier to interact quick than a GPS device, it will reduce the frustration of the driver.

Listening to music can help the driver focus better. It can also wake up a tired driver up by blasting some music. However, a GPS device cannot do that; with its monotone robotic voice, it would make the driver get even more bored. Another reason why a smartphone cannot be replaced by GPS device or why we should be able to use our cellphone is that, in the case of an emergency. Drivers can easily access a smartphone and call for help while if you had a GPS device, not so much.

In conclusion, I think that we all should be able to use a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Of course, not in a way that they will be completely distracted by it, but by limiting the applications that we can access. Again, anything can go wrong if used incorrectly, so I do not see the reason why we should ban a cellphone from using it as a tool to help us drive better. However, the punishment for misusing such a device should be punished heavily. It is truly sad to see how many people are getting distracted by a small device and killing lives after lives. Cellphone usage while operating a vehicle should be monitored, and managed, by the government or the police, with a strong action, however, banning of a usage of smartphones will cost just as same amount of lives as if it was not.",1
"Phones and Driving

Cellphones are a big part of the modern world today. Everywhere you look there are people using their cellphone, but one place no one should never be using their phone in their vehicle. Driving while using a cellphone is very dangerous. If someone has received a text while driving they should ignore it until they get to their destination, or a accident could occur.

When someone is driving their phone should either be in their console or in the driver side door, and it should be on silent. There should only be one exception to use a phone while driving, and that is if someone needs to use their GPS. Then it should be in a secure place where they can hear the directions and know where to go.

Texting while driving can be very dangerous, it can cause accidents and they may be fatal. No text call should be so important that it cost someone their life. Phones are very good to have just not in the car.",1
"Phones and Driving

To some being on the phone while driving is not a big deal at all, while to others it is. Yet while for those certain people who think cellphone use while driving is not a big deal the statistics would suggest otherwise. So far in the year 2018 it has been reported that over 58% of car accidents have been caused by or are linked to cellphone use.

This alone would suggest that even for those who do not look at cellphone use while driving as a big deal that it obviously is one. As a result of this the ""Hands Free"" law which has been around in some states for decades was recently added and enforced in many other states. Including Georgia in July of 2018. The ""Hands Free"" Law suggests that an driver who is caught driving with their phone in their hand will receive a ticket with a fine. However you are allowed to use exactly one finger to navigate whatever it is you need on your device, while this is an exception is it really much of a difference? its still time b being devoting to something other than driving.

While it is unfortunate for those who are capable of multi-tasking and are able to drive safely while using their phone. Overall it is much more beneficial to everyone's safety if phones are just removed from the equation all together. Although unfortunately there are still millions of people who constantly break the laws each day and will continue to jeopardize everyone's safety for their own personal satisfaction by using their devices while driving. However I believe there are many more steps we could take to help decrease the cellphone use while driving. Some apps and even cellphones are working to prevent the usage while driving by adding improvements that can monitor when people have began to drive and will lock the phone automatically while some just will block usage unless you are a passenger, this program is very helpful and a great encouragement but that still doesn't change the fact that the apps that people tend to use while driving aren't doing anything of that sort.

In many situations people only understand the severity of things once they happen, there are two different people int he world. the 'better safe than sorry' and the 'oh nothing will never happen, i know what I'm doing' people, there are definitely not enough of the better safe then sorry people , as humans we think our problems are more important than others and that is definitely not what driving is about , driving is about watching your surroundings at all times and anything that distracts you from it is something you shouldn't be doing

In conclusion cellphones and driving are just a bad combination that definitely has proven not to mix well. Yet sadly for some it is too large of a task to put the phone down and focus on the road. While police and some software developers are doing everything they can to limit the use of cellphones in the car, we will continue to see the problem for a while. However it has been reported that in Georgia since implementing the ""Hands Free"" law there has been a pretty significant decrease in accidents caused by cellphone usage. Noting that from January to June the percentage of accidents caused by cellphones was 67% but from July when the law was added up to now November accidents caused by cellphone use has dropped to just 39% in the state of Georgia.

Hopefully after reading this if you haven't already realized how detrimental cellphones are to our safety and that they are just not worth the risk nor the fine you could receive if you are caught driving while on your phone. As safety will always be the most important especially when it comes to driving as a bad accident could easily mean life or death or a very serious injury which many may not be able to recover from. Phones are just not worth risking you and others lives.",1
"What is so special about texting and driving? Is the person you're texting more valuable than your life? These are the two questions you should ask yourself before picking up your phone while you are behind the wheel. The statistics are out of this world people are dying every day because of distracted drivers. Texting and driving is very dangerous because during the time you check your phone your brain cells reaction time slows down and it causes a potential accident.

In 2018 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use. In my opinion I say that people should not use their cell phone while driving. People lose their lives everyday just because of a single text or phone call. Researchers have come to a conclusion that using your phone while driving is 6x dangerous than driving drunk. If you answer or check a text that could take about 5 seconds but if you are traveling 65 mph while doing that who knows what can happen in those seconds. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving .74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. The fact that those numbers do not equal out are problem and this is why I do not agree that people should be allowed to use their phone while driving.

Texting while driving is a problem now more than it has ever been, as 69 percent of U.S. drivers between the ages of 18 and 64 admitted to using their cell phone while driving during the previous month. Texting increases a crash by 23 times, it's a habit that must be stopped, across age groups and geographic locations alike. 40 percent of teens state that they've been in the car with a car with someone who was diving when using their cell phone in a way that put them in some kind of danger. While the maximum amount of time a driver can safely can change their attention from the road from is two seconds, it takes a driver five seconds on average to send a text message. Besides talking to your teen regularly about this issue and setting a good example by not using your cell phone while driving yourself, there are other simple ways to monitor your teen's phone use while they're behind the wheel. Start by activating smartphone features that help prohibit texting while driving. We need to take advantage of technology, utilizing apps that allow you as the parent more transparency into your child's whereabouts and driving habits.

In my opinion I think people should turn their phones off while driving. In this generations words don't mean anything. Signs don't mean anything. There are signs everywhere that say don't text and drive but due to the research nobody is listening. Companies are trying to go around this rule by making a profit. What I mean by that is we say don't text and drive but here's an example apple air pods you simply tap your ear and say text so and so and in an instant your message has been sent to whoever. I don't think that's safe either in no way is texting and driving safe. Even if you try to make it easier in my opinion there is no way that it can be safe. If you take your eyes off the road for even a second, the most dreadful things could happen. To many people die for that one text back that could have waited until you stopped or could have waited until you got to a red light. Many teenagers don't know that you could ruin your in literally 5 seconds.

There is one case in which your life can be saved when texting and driving. There is a law called the hands free law. Texting and driving could either be paid with your life or a ticket. In Georgia, the texting and driving ticket is the highest in the nation. If you get caught in Georgia that is a $150 ticket for violating the distracted driving law as well as one point on your driving record. The highest ticket you could be fined to is $1,000 in Iowa I think you're better off just following the hands free law. More money you get to keep in your pocket. Then to think about if you're texting and driving there's a possibility of you losing your life and a possibility of you killing someone else.

In conclusion, Texting and driving is very dangerous but tempting. Teenagers are the most tempted to text and drive. The technology today is controlling are minds. Why not use it to save our lives? There are way too many people making a simple mistake that will determine if they have another day to live. In the future we will find more ways to break this horrible habit that so many people are used to. Parents should teach their kids how to drive without distractions. Friends should teach each other that no matter what they need at the moment no boyfriend or girlfriend information is more valuable than their life. The message will wait remember your life wont. To save your life and other people lives follow the hands free law.",1
"You should not text while Driving

Should you be able to use your phone while driving? I say you shouldn't because it can cause some of the scariest moments that you'll ever dreamt of. It will put your life at risk and the passenger's life as well, and You will become a danger to those around while being addictive to your tech especially in the era.

Putting yourself in threat.... was it worth it just think about it? You are literally giving death an option. Regardless of how fast you think you can look at your phone without getting in a car accident, believe it or not it only takes less than five seconds for everything to change. One out of four cars get into an accident and you could be one of them. Over 330,000 accidents are caused by the driver using their phone while driving. I know you don't want to die like that or young when your life is ahead of you, think about your friends and family that care for you. Don't be selfish to them all because you wanted to text and drive because it will kill you.

Not only your putting yourself in harm but you're also placing the passenger life in danger, as matter of fact their lives are just as important as yours, so you shouldn't be careless. Over 37,000 people die in accidents, and which 20% of it were the other people in the car. I am sure that they didn't want to be a part of those database and being in the position to where their life could be end with a terrible outcome. It can cause them to be paralyzed to where they would rather had die in the accident because you the driver decided to not care about the other person in the car. By you not being responsible you took everything away from them. They will never be active how they were before the accident ever again.

Texting while driving has done a lot of damage, it's one of the most dangerous ways to die. Each year over 200,000 had been a car wreck, and that number is slowly inclining. Having teenagers on the road makes it even worse especially in the generation we live in today. Where it's a social media word and everyone is on it nonstop, you can't even leave your phone down for not even five mins. It must stop cause while we are in this era it will only take a huge downturn.

If we keep repeating current actions that makes it so treacherous to drive on the highway. The more people will die and double the accidents will transpire. All lives matter so put the phone down and keep your eye on the target.",1
"Cell phones has the ability to be real distraction and is an easily entertainment while being behind the wheel. In a daily basis people tend to multitask but there are times and place to do so. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with especially with a cellphones. You always have to keep in mind how something could change in a blink of an eye. One minor mistake on the road can cause your life or someone else's life to be taken therefore, drivers should not be able to us cell phones while driving.

Fatality is an occurrence of death by accident. Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving. According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (""On the road""). Nearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving. In 2016 3,450 fatalities were caused by texting and driving (""texting and driving accident statistics""). Also one over four car crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving. In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of death.

Texting and driving is just dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is most common and dangerous thing you can do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk (""On the Road""). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is. Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol. Steering control while distracted in 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration. In 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that's number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distraction driving resulted in approximately 2,600 death in 2002. The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities. Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving under the influence.

Texting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the insurance institute for highway safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers. Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason. In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense. There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise.

Specifically banning teen drivers from texting reduced traffic deaths in that group by 11 percent.

In summary, drivers should know that they are dealing with something serious when driving a car. There are limited chances in life; texting and driving are pushing those chances away. Drive with intent and purpose to get to your destination. Deal with texts after or before you drive, because it could cost you everything. Attention is highly needed when driving, there are split-second decisions to be made while driving and your phone distracts your attention enough to potentially cause in accident. Your reaction time is based on how early you see it, looking at a phone prohibits you from reacting. In conclusion put your phone away while driving to save lives.",1
"Phones and Driving

There are many dangers to driving, but playing with your phone is probably one of the worst. When you play with your phone behind the wheel you not only endanger yourself, but everyone else in the car as well as other drivers. It distracts you from what is important keeping your eyes on the road. Phone usage while driving is one of the biggest problems we have with drivers today.

""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

"Distracted driving is becoming a huge problem in the world today. One of the main distractions is something that most people have with them everywhere they go, it is known as the cell phone. Cell phone use while driving causes many wrecks and injuries every single year. In fact, the majority of crashes every year are caused by distracted driving, due to cell phone usage. This being said, people should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving unless they have a hands-free option.

Many people believe that they are capable of multi-tasking. The main thing people think they can multi-task at is texting and driving. When you are behind the wheel you are always automatically expected to keep your full attention on the road. Failing to do so could result in something as minor as a ticket, or something as major as a wreck that could seriously injure or kill someone. Let's say that you're driving down a not so busy street in a neighborhood. You think that because the street is empty that you should be able to text and drive without any issues, so you pull your phone out to text your mom. You don't even have time to glance down and back up before you run into a solid brick mail box, causing the inflation of your airbags. When that airbag deploys, it causes fractures to your face, and blunt trauma to your cervical spine. Was it worth it?

According to many websites, at least 1.6 million accidents per year are due to texting and driving. Out of these accidents, around 3,500 people are killed and at least 421,000 people are injured. Many states now have laws that require you to be parked in a safe place before using your phone and failing to do so will result in a ticket. In most states you are not allowed to even have your phone on your person while driving. It must be put in a seat or in the console of your car out of reach.

There are reasons upon reasons as to why you should not be allowed to use your phone and drive. Many people don't realize, especially young people, that phone usage while driving can cause your insurance to go up a lot. I'm sure you'd rather put your phone down, than to have to pay extra each month because you had to use your phone. Another thing people don't realize is that when you are on your phone and driving, your reaction time is worse than if you were to be driving under the influence of alcohol.

Texting and driving should never be an option for anyone these days. We have so much hands-free technology, that you shouldn't even have to look at your phone while you are behind the wheel. No matter the situation or who the text is from, if you ever feel the need to pick up your phone, pull into a parking lot and make sure you're safe. Remember next time you put your car in drive and go to reach for your cell phone, how many lives, including your own, that you would be putting in danger.",1
"[Phones & Driving]

Technology and driving are a very dangerous pair they have taken so many innocent lives because people's faces are glued to their phone. In 2016 263 teen's age's (16 to 19) were killed by distracted driving. The NHTSA estimates that every day 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while behind the wheel. That's a lot of lives at stake because people are careless and can't just pull their eyes away from their phone's just to drive down the street.

In 2018 about 4,637 people died in car accidents related to distracted driving, by using cellphones. The technology of today has evolved or progressed to where there are so many new gadgets and apps that were constantly looking down at our screens. We also are always taking picture or videos while trying to drive and if you aren't recording yourself then you're probably trying to pose for the camera. Even when u don't like to drive and text or do whatever on your phone there are always going to be friends or family that encourage or want u to do something on your phone while driving. Out of all the crashes in the world 26% of those crashes are caused by texting and driving.

My reason for writing this essay is to agree that talking or being on a device while driving is dangerous. Here I will list my reasons for it being dangerous. First off it puts yourself and other drivers in harm's way and possibly hurt badly or even killed. That's you should put your phone away when driving or do whatever you have to do on it before you get on the road. Secondly you should think about the consequences before you do it such as, if I do this will it harm me and my drivers, or people in the vehicle with me. Even if you are a cellphone addict you should think about others before you drive and text.

So for the conclusion of my essay I will end it by saying this driving and text is a very bad way to hurt yourself and others on the road so if you care put down the phone, and put your eyes on the road. The world would be a safer place without people texting and driving and not paying attention to the road and their surroundings. We ask that the people that are texting and driving to please stop, because they are killing or are putting peoples children on the road in danger. I along with a bunch of other people feel distracted driving has to stop now.",1
"Phones and Driving

So everybody knows the question should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving? Now depending on who you are this answer might be different. However, for me it's a no. Drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving because the use of cell phone is distracting.

Driving is a privilege and can be taking away so it's best to just put away distractions.

Now you and I both know cellphones are distracting as I mentions in my first paragraph, but how are they distracting? Well they are distracting by sending e-mails, texts, or pictures. Driver think that if they get a text that they can just respond really fast. However, those three seconds you take to respond can be the cause of a huge accident. Drivers just need to be aware that text can wait because you do not want to put yourself and others in harm over a text.

Finally let's get on to the facts. Statics show that about 1.6million crashes happen each year due to cellphone usage. They also show that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to car accidents and 9 of those deaths are due to distracted drivers. But car accidents can be costly in other like increased insurance and fixing cars hurt you financially or you can break a bone and be hurt physically and financially because you have to pay for medication. These can also lead to other very stressful situations.

So to conclude if you are driving do not use your cellphone. The text or e-mail can wait until you have reached your destination. If you do you can harm yourself and others. Overall using a cellphone while driving cannot only be deadly but costly.",1
"Phones and Driving

The number one cause of death among teenagers is car accidents. We can only assume that a number of these accidents were caused by distracted drivers. A distraction can come from anything, the radio, food, passengers in the car, and especially, the topic of this essay, cell phones.

The epidemic of drivers dying by the distraction of cell phones has become a major problem in the US because more and more technical advancements are happening as time goes on. When people are distracted while driving, even though it isn't intentional and they may not be thinking about it at the time, they are putting themselves and others' lives at risk. In the state of Georgia, it has become an official law that you can't even have your cell phone in your hand while driving. It is called the ""Hands-free"" law. You have to either have it completely put away, or up on a hands free cell phone stand in your car. If you get caught with your phone in your hand while driving in Georgia, you will get a ticket.

Currently there is no national law banning the use of cell phones while driving in the US; however, 39 out of 50 states now have laws banning the use of cell phones while driving, and almost every year a new one gets added. The rates of deaths by texting while driving have decreased since. In 2017, over 3,000 lives had been claimed by distracted driving, almost 300 of those lives being teens. That number has decreased since then.

In order to stop this epidemic from growing or even continuing, a national law banning cell phone use while driving should be put into place. Every year, the US is getting closer to that goal.",1
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. People are killed everyday by using their phones while driving. Sometimes people end up killing others while texting and driving. Laws have been passed to prevent texting and driving but many people still do it. These careless people make it difficult for other drivers to feel safe on the road.

You are more likely to crash if you're texting and driving. You are looking at your phone which causes your eyes to be taken away from the road. By the time you look back on to the road you could be seconds away from causing an accident. This gives you very little time to react and usually results in death or injury. You can just as easily pull over to the side of the road and text whoever you are texting. Or you could silence your phone and wait until you get to your destination to text back.

According to https://www. edgarsnyder. com 660,000 people text and drive everyday. 1.6 million people die from using their cell phones while operating a vehicle each year. Some people text and drive because they think they can multitask. Others do it because they like their phones or texting so much that they do it anywhere. Most people who use their phone while driving are teenagers or young adults. The average age range is from 18 to 34.

Compared to adults the percentage of those who use their phones and drive go down by at least 48 percent. Older people most likely don't use their phone while driving because they grew up in a time where they did not have advanced social media or technology and did not feel the need to be on their phones throughout the day.

Another reason you should not use your phone while driving is that you could get pulled over and ticketed. It is not hard for a police officer to catch you texting and driving. Most of them could tell by just looking at you since most people look down at their phones or hold it in front of them. A first offence ticket for texting and driving costs around 50 dollars and one point on your license. A second offense costs 100 dollars and a third offense costs 150 dollars. The points on your license go up until the number reaches 15 points in a two year period according to https://www. ajc. com/blog/commuting/georgia-distracted-driving-law-how-win-court/5vKbMEv47Mdrz2mRTBkkpK/. Once the points reach 15 your license will be taken.

Texting and driving can be avoided in many of the following ways. 1. By pulling over to the side of the road. 2. By keeping your phone out of sight and reach. 3. By turning off do not disturb. 4. By mounting your phone to something if you are using a navigation app. 5. By leaving your phone at home. The list could go on and on. Using your phone and driving is a bad and sometimes expensive habit. You should not do this.",1
"Should you be able to be on the phone while driving? These days people text and talk on the phone while they drive. To me it is not safe because you can hurt other people on the road or other people in the car with you.

People like me want their family to come home in one-piece and for people to get hurt because someone was playing with their phone is not right at all. Therefore, I say there should be a law against people having their phone out while driving.

Teenagers are most likely to get in a car accident because of phones. I think teens get in more accidents than adults because they have their whole life on their phones and forget they are driving. Also, when they have drama in their life they have to check their phones every other second to see what this and that person said about them. Then they want to be all over social media to show people they are driving. The next thing you know they hit another car and someone is hurt. Lastly, they feel like they must text their boyfriend or girlfriend back as fast as they rather than wait until they are no longer driving.

Texting and driving are one of the most dangerous things in the whole world to me. I say that because people know that texting and driving is dangerous, and they still do it. Then when it happens they say it's not their fault and they know they were on their phone. When they see that they hurt somebody, they ack like they are scared and sorry but all they had to do is put down the phone and drive the right way. That is how most car accidents happen these days. It could all be prevented if the phones were put down.

It is clear to see why texting and driving is not smart. Just think, what if every time you put up your phone you save a family from getting hurt. What if it was your family getting hurt because somebody is on their phones. How would u feel? You wouldn't like it so why do it.

If you just put the phone down the world would be safer. This is something that can be prevented.

PLEASE DON'T BE ON YOUR PHONE WHILE DRIVING. REMEMBER YOU CAN SAVE A LIFE IF YOU JUST PUT IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Cellphones are mere distractions from focusing on the road, there have been nearly 400,000 accidents from one device.

The only appropriate way to use cellphones are using them as map directions, Teenagers and adults should be restricted using their phones while going out driving. Motorcycles are no different from cars, they are more difficult to control driving with one hand on the handles. Parents should only let teenagers drive if they are trustworthy from using their phones.

Parents should also buy a safe and advanced car to provide GPS and hand-free calls. Vehicles nowadays have screens installed which have cameras on the back to see what is in the way, the vehicles have Bluetooth for your phone without distracting you from using it and rely on the car for your safety.

This year have been 586 accident that did not end well. When driving, make sure all passengers have seatbelts on and be aware of the passenger's condition and position due to the airbag that could possibly hurt a child in the front seat. Do not consume any alcohol or harmful chemicals that influence your driving",1
"Many people, especially teenagers, are dying because of the use of cell phones while driving. The question is, should people be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

I believe people should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

People get distracted very quickly when they are on the phone. Many accidents are caused because people try to read or respond to text messages while driving. Even when using a hands free device such as a Bluetooth, talking on the phone is still very distracting and causes the driver to pay less attention to other cars.

According to the National Safety Council (NSC), ""Everyday 9 people are killed and more than 1000 people were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers"" (National Safety Council, 2019). In the same article, the National Safety Council said that ""drivers looking out the windshield can miss seeing up to 50% of what's around them when talking on a cell phone"" (National Safety Council,2019).

The NSC also reminds people in the article that your mind can only process one task at a time, so you cannot talk on the phone and read a book at the same time (National Safety Council, 2019).

This is why even if you are using a hands free device to talk on the phone, the conversation is still occupying your mind while you are supposed to be focused on driving.

Most states have fines for being caught texting while driving. If you are texting while driving and kills someone, you could be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter. If found guilty of these charges, you could spend a lot of time in jail. I think this is a really good law because even though it doesn't stop everyone from texting while driving, it does stop some people who know this is a law and they could go to jail for breaking it.

In conclusion people shouldn't be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Many people have lost loved ones and their own lives because of driving while being on their cellphones. Driving while texting and killing someone will put you in prison for a very long time. Distracted driving, like just talking on the phone, causes many accidents. No conversation is that important. Just wait until you are not driving.

"Despite laws against it nearly 90% of Americans still use their phones while driving. This being said phones should not and are not supposed to be used while driving. Smart phones have made it simple to stay connected at all times, but behind the wheel should not be one of those times. According to DMV.org texting and driving is the leading cause of death in teens. When you decide to do anything on your phone while driving you are putting more value on what you are doing instead of the lives around you. The act of being on a phone while driving is not only illegal, but also poses a distraction and puts you and others in danger.

At least 9 people are killed every day because of a distracted driver (DMV.org). When you are using you phone well driving it incorporates all 3 types of driving distractions. One being visual: takes your eyes off the road. Sometimes you can look at more than one thing at a time, but the road and phone are not included. Trying to send a text while driving is like trying to read a book and walk. The next type of distraction is manual: taking your hands off the wheel. Typing calls for two hands most of the time and driving calls for two hand, so unfortunately we only have two to give and I promise driving is the better option. The last type of distraction is cognitive: takes your focus away from driving. Most people have taken their eyes off the road to look at a cow or something of that nature and realized something bad almost happened and that is just a split second. Now imagine doing this at 55mph taking your eyes off to read a text, and reading takes a bit more concentration than just looking at a cow.

In addition to texting and driving being a distraction it is also illegal. A large number of U.S. states have passed law corresponding to this danger. Penalties for breaking these laws include: fines, license suspension, raise in auto insurance, and prison time. Do you really what to have on your chest the thought of you killing a father, mother, son, daughter just because you could wait to send a text? If you think about it the penalties are given to people who actually commit crimes. Do you want to do in the same category as a rapist? All of this because you couldn't put your phone up to get from point A to point B.

These penalties are the same as ones you get for a DUI. Thus meaning when you text and drive you are just as dangerous as an intoxicated driver. Driving with a BAC of just 0.01% increases your chances of causing a car crash by 46%, according to a 2014 study. If you'd never drive drunk why would you ever text and drive. Also According to the NHTSA texting and driving is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. Texting and driving is just as bad as drinking 2 beers. If you see how bad drunk driving accidents are why would you want to put yourself and others in the same situation just for a text?

In a word being distracted while driving is among the top most dangerous things you can do on the road. This is a bad habit to have but habits can be broken. Working on it now can save you and others from a world of pain and suffering later. There is no point in paying fines and jail time or even possibly killing somebody or yourself for a text. So next time you think about picking up a phone think again and put it down.",1
"Too many people during these present days stay on the phone while driving. People should not be able to use cellphones while driving. Over 1.6 million crashes yearly happen according to The National Safety Council. More than 220 million people in the US have a wireless service and just about 80 percent use phones while driving. Did you know you can be charged with multiple charges and a fee of 150 dollars and you lose a point to your driving record.

To me phones should not be used on the roads unless it is for an emergency. I have personally had an experience when my mom was texting and driving which led us almost getting into a car accident. Results from using phones while driving can lead to death, PTSD, depression if you get into a car accident. Using a phone while driving increases the risk of their lives. Also the drivers are more distracted making it hard to focus on the road which is leading to crashing. When stopped at a red light people feel as if it is safe little do they know it is just as risky because a car can come smashing into you and you wouldn't see it. Also you can make people mad because the light could turn green and you could be holding up a line.

For people to use their phone less there was a bluetooth, a hands free thing and air play which all 3 limit the use of the phone where you can just talk. It still is not safe but it is not as bad as using your actual phone. Instead of holding the phone to your ear you just speak, call whoever and you don't have to touch your phone. It is easier to just wait to text or use your phone than to rather take your life. For Iphone users apple company made a do not disturb to mute the notifications, which is when you won't receive any notifications until you turn that mode off. There is also a driving mode you can turn on to send a message to a person who texts or calls you saying that you are driving and they won't see their message until they stop driving and check it.

People shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because of how many crashes there have been yearly and in the past. If you end up using your phone remember there are different modes like the hands free, bluetooth, or airplay. There are a lot of effects that could leave u dead, with PTSD, depression and many other things. You can use the do not disturb as stated, the driving message mode where it sends a message. The laws should be changed on how phones shouldn't be used and they should make it more serious.",1
"Texting and driving puts innocent lives at risk every day, Higher risk than drunk drivers. However, some people feel that creating a law against phone usage is violating personal rights. Others feel that banning someone from using their cell phones is equivalent to telling someone that they can't adjust their radio or talk to someone else in their car. However, using a phone, whether talking or texting, while driving can be dangerous to your family or friends in the car including you and the people of your surroundings. All of the damage you could cause and all that has been caused in the past can and still could be avoided by simply pulling over. There are so many places to stop over and relax while you drink something and respond to the text where it is safe. If everyone turned their phone off before getting in the car, then there would be no worries about feeling the urge or need to pick up the phone and risk lifes. Research shows that while on the phone, crash risk quadruples.

Well-enforced traffic laws have been a highly effective countermeasure for reducing risky driving behaviors and the associated crashes, deaths, and injuries. However, it is not clear that laws limiting drivers' cellphone use are having the same beneficial effects. The research on the effects of driver cellphone and texting bans found mixed results. Even though the law has passed people are still going to text and drive but it helped a little and scared a few younger people being a law.",1
"Do you use a cell phone when you drive ? I know people use their cell phones for just about everything. But unfortunately people are choosing to use their cell phones at the wrong time, while they are driving which is very dangerous not only to themselves but others on the road as well. I personally don't think phones should be used while driving do you ?.

Cell phones are used in our daily life in this day and age, but sometimes it could be dangerous for us to use them like while driving. Using a cellphone while driving is dangerous not only for the driver but everyone out there on the road as well. When driving with a cell phone it is sometimes hard to focus on the road which is putting your life and others life at risk. Everyday people die in car accidents because they made the choice to use a cellphone while driving.

According to research cell phones are the main cause of accidents, and studies show that using a cell phone while driving puts drivers at a four time greater risk of a car accident.

There are people that believe that having a cell phone while driving is ok, because they believe that sending a text message only takes your eyes off the road for a few seconds, but what they do not know is that in those few seconds something terrible could happen. When a cell phone is used you don't think about your surroundings and how it may affect others around you that's how it is when driving and using a cell phone. The number one cause of car accidents just so happen to be distracted driving. Also increases the number of deaths per year.

In conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving, sending a quick text message or checking your phone is not worth losing your life or someone else's. I believe that doing so would be inconsiderate of other drivers and also pedestrians as well. Also it is illegal in many states. There are other ways than a cell phone to communicate that are less dangerous for example a bluetooth earpiece. But don't use the phone for the safety of yourself and others.",1

"Phones and Driving

In today's society phones are heavily used and relied on. The use of phones while operating a vehicle can result in minor to major injuries or a fatal life taking crash. In the year 2017, there was a little more than 3,000 people that died due to the use of phones while driving. It is indicated that phones may be an effective way of communicating, using cell phones while occupying a car results in the attention of driver decreasing and road safety concerns increase. A large percentage of fatal crashes involved cell phones. This essay will be informing you of why you shouldn't use or have a phone in your hand while driving.

First and foremost, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle can affect the passengers and other drivers surrounding them.

When a driver gets distracted it slows down their reaction rate by 37% which is more than being drunk and driving or being high on cannabis and driving. According to the website, https://www. dailymail. co. uk/news/article-2652015/Texting-driving-slows-reaction-times-drink-drugs. html when your driving with a phone in your hand it becomes more of a priority to see what is happening in the world right now or to see what people are posting and who texted them. Technology has become the world's best friend but also the world's worst enemy, technology itself has many trials and errors that have caused worldwide outbreaks of hacking or leaked information.

In addition, the technology used in cars today is well advanced and continues to improve. In today's cars, technologies such as bluetooth help improve a person's ability to drive. Bluetooth is a setting that can decrease the use of phones while driving. Bluetooth is a hand's free setting which allows you to control the majority of your apps on your phone from your car. Furthermore, the advancement of Smart Technology on one of the most used devices, our phones, have also helped drivers become more safe. According to, https://www. frayneaccidentinjurylaw. com/blog/prevent-car-accidents-tech/ engineers have come up with auto- braking, rear cameras, etc. The use of this technology in a car is crucial because it gives you another sense you never knew you needed.

Undoubtedly, others may say that phones do not distract them and that they can multi- task. Over a million crashes have happened in almost a year. According to https://www. teendriversource. org/teen-crash-risks-prevention/distracted-driving/cell-phones Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Even if you believe that you are focused and you're not distracted, science could prove otherwise. It takes the brain at least 20 minutes to get back on track for you to be able to focus. You don't have 20 minutes while your driving to focus on the road, it only takes 1 minute to cause a crash, imagine what could happen in 20. No matter how focused you think you are your not. Every couple of minutes a car crash has happened do to a distracted driver texting on their phone.

In conclusion, texting and driving should not be allowed anywhere in the world, phones itself should not be allowed while operating any kind of vehicle. Although people break this law everyday they don't think about the risks of what can happen to them or others around them. Other drivers on the road notice of drivers on their phones whether they want to or not because of the dangers that are created.

"In this generation everyone has a phone. I got my first phone when I was in 8th grade and since then I've just been on it probably 24/7.

When I got old enough my parents were really scared in letting me drive because they really thought I was going to text and drive. And the only fault that I could point to is this generation. There are 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. I promise you if you go outside right now you will see at least one out of every 2 cars texting and driving. Teenagers just think it's cool until sadly they learn the hard way.

To start everything, I just would like to say that I do not agree with texting and driving. Teenagers driving and texting literally, leads to nothing good. With us being teenage drivers, we are automatically easily distracted. Now imagine how our bodies react when we hear that ""ding"" that we get a message from a boyfriend / girlfriend. Your body just reacts in a way I can't describe and it's like you HAVE to answer. Then with you answering you get distracted and that means you're not paying attention to the road and/or your surroundings. And the rest isn't anything pretty to talk about.

What happens next isn't anything pretty to talk about. Like I said in my first paragraph nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from texting and driving. I've personally witness several accidents on my way to work. Some are worse than others but still, regardless of how ""big or small"" the accident is, ITS still an accident. Then in that spilt second you think to yourself and ask if that text was really truly worth it. There's a quote that I always remember when it comes to texting and driving, "" it can wait"" think about it , what would of happened if you did wait to text back? Maybe there would have been no accident, I guess no one will ever know because YOU chose to answer that text.

My final thought in this essay, is my personal experience. One day I was coming home from work and I was texting my girlfriend and I blinked and within that second I got into a car accident. I've never felt my heart beat that fast before, I was extremely scared in thinking if he was okay and if I was going to get my butt whooped. My other experience is my 3 friends who passed away last year. They were speeding along with some texting and sadly they all passed away. it was a very tragic year, leaning to live without them. And that's why I got all 3 of them tattooed on me. A reminder that im not suppose to text and drive.

That will conclude my essay but like I said , I DO NOT support texting and driving. Even blasting music and driving. Some people just don't understand that driving is not a game. Its something serious and with your actions you can ether kill someone or prevent from killing someone.",1
"Phones and Driving

Every year many people around the world are dying because of cell phone use while driving. Instead of keeping their eyes on the road, people keep their eyes on the phone. This leads to crashes, death, and injuries. While cell phone use can be beneficial in times of emergency or while using G.P.S, cell phones should not be used while driving.

First, using phones while driving can lead to crashing. You can either crash into a sign or into somebodies' car. This leads to paying somebody money to fix your car or paying for someone else's car because you hit them. Also your license can get suspended. This all happened because you were on your phone not paying attention to the road.

Next, unfortunately people who get into crashes don't always make it. When you're on your phone while you're driving and you get into a crash not only can you die but you can kill somebody else. Basically, because your being irresponsible you can cause somebody to die. Is it really worth killing somebody because you want to use your cellular device while driving. This is another reason phones shouldn't be used while driving.

Finally, phones shouldn't be used while driving because if you crash and you don't die you cause injuries for life for your victim or you. Although, people sometimes use phones for G.P.S some cars are built for that. Even phone calls. If you want call somebody hook your phone up to Bluetooth before driving. This is another reason why phones shouldn't be used while driving.

So in conclusion, phones should not be used while driving. This is because of crashes, injuries, and possibly death. This is just irresponsible behavior that's leading to problems for people. Especially when there are so many ways to prevent the situation. Do you believe phones should be used while driving?",1
"Texting While Driving While there are many causes of deaths in the United States, a huge epidemic that concerns officials more and more is the amount of deaths occurring because of texting while driving. Texting and driving can kill in split second just the amount of time it takes to send a ""quick"" text message. Texting and driving is known to the world as one of the most dangerous things to do while on the road. Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but also much more dangerous to the people and cars surrounding that particular individual.

According to many people texting and driving is similar if not identical to that of drunk driving. For example texting and driving physically and mentally impairs you to drive straight down a road, without causing a danger to people. As a whole population, we need to stop the use of texting and driving whether it's putting laws in place or designing a program that shuts off the use of texting the moment you step foot in the car.

The effects of texting while driving also can cause extremely hazardous driving conditions that compromise the safety of the driver and their passengers along with other drivers sharing the roads and highways. Because texting requires at least one hand on the device and the driver's eyes away from the road, the focus of the driver is not fully devoted to controlling the vehicle. This often leads to lane deviation that could possibly result in potentially dangerous situations.

Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.",1
"Because it's a common activity for most people, sending a text doesn't seem dangerous. However, when you're doing it behind the wheel, there are a ton of other factors at play. Driving is a privilege because of the inherent risk and responsibility we all need to assume out on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers.

It can be hard to grasp the dangers of texting and driving, but once you know the facts, this hazardous habit starts to become a reality. When you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. In just the 5 seconds it takes to send or read a short text message, you've already zoomed past the length of a football field with minimal attention on the road ahead. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children.

No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel.

When you're behind the wheel, you should always be considerate of other drivers and remember you're putting your life at risk while texting and driving.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed?

While driving, you should always be focused on getting from point A to point B. Having any kind of mobile device in your hand while driving puts your life at a major risk. Once driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text message, suddenly the driver's life is changed by a horrific accident. People should definitely reconsider before pulling out their phones while on the road. Dr",1
"No Cell Phone Use While Driving

While driving down the road in her car, Jirah's cell phone rings, but she tries to not pay attention to the phone. Later, her phone lights up for a text message. She thinks that this could be important, so she checks the message. CRASH! Next thing she knows, she is waking up in a hospital,with her family and friends trying to tell her she was in a car accident. She tells her family and friends what happened for her to crash. She was texting and driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"" (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). Based on this information, a lot of people have crashed their cars and been hurt or lost their lives to cell phone use while driving. Using cell phones while driving puts the driver and others at risk, and there should be no cell phone use (texting or talking) while driving because it can cause wrecks and even death.

First, texting while driving is dangerous because it distracts the person driving which can cause an accident. When a person is using a cellphone while driving, the focus is on the text message and not on the road. Drivers need to be focused on just driving. Texting is very popular today, especially with people my age, and texting while driving has become really easy to do.

This affects my generation the most because, according to the article on ""Texting and Driving Accidents Statistics-Distracted Driving"", ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving""; teen brains, like mine, are trained to quickly pick up their phone when they hear a notification (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). When teens get text messages or calls from their partners or friends, they become more worried about that notification, and it seems that they sometimes forget they are driving. Cellphones can be like the devil.

The person is constantly tempted to use the cellphone at the wrong time and can become attached to it, which causes a lot of danger.

Talking on the cell phone while driving is also dangerous because it distracts the driver, too. Whether it is bluetooth or holding the phone in your hand, this distraction causes car accidents which can cause death of the driver and others. According to the TeenSafe article, ""it takes only 3 seconds after a driver's attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). That being said, no matter how careful one thinks they are being, one moment of being distracted can change a person's life. When driving distracted by your cell phone, you can get into arguments with someone on the phone or can get horrible news that can cause you to lose focus on the road. This loss of focus can easily cause terrible injuries or even deaths. A lot of people have lost their lives because of their decision to talk or text on phones while driving.

To sum it all up, one should not drive and use their cell phone due to how dangerous it is. Driving distracted by a cell phone can cause car accidents with terrible injuries and even death.

Distracted driving is dangerous to everyone, especially teens. According to an article on distracted driving, ""driver distraction is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). Adults and teens put themselves and others at risk when they make the selfish decision to use their phones and drive. As studies continue to show, use of cellphones while driving isn't safe and causes harm and death to many people in our country. We can all do our part and put the cell phone away while driving. The life you save may be your own. Stay safe and make good choices. Do not lose your life over your cell phone.

"Much like the strike of a cobra, cellphones seemingly hit and instantly impacted the world. Their prevalence in today's society is undeniable and has become one of the world's most widespread tools. Their knack-like size employs their use at almost all times, allowing their beholder to multitask while using the device. This one small trait is the very essence of people's disagreement with them. Many people stand against using cellphones and driving as this creates a problem for all drivers near and far. Cellphones should not be used while driving if you wish to be able to use it again.

The age of cellphones started, what seems like, yesterday and they had already grabbed the public's eye. They allowed people to stay in touch even when the ones they wish to touch aren't near by. This very reason is what created the epidemic and addiction to cellphone, connection. The connection across all boundaries is what's gotten so many people glued to their cellphones. People nowadays can't go 10 minutes without checking their phones. Almost everywhere you go, phones-phones-phones, their everywhere, in people's hands, to people's ears, in their pockets, their unavoidable. It's even gone so far that many professionals have begun questioning if cellphone addiction is real.

Another major part of the problem is teenagers. As teenagers began to transition into the real world, some the first things they get are cellphones and their driver's license. The phone almost always becomes an attachment. Along with the freedom to drive, this creates problematic gaps in society. Many teens are not the most focused individuals. They are often guided by impulse rather than intellect, and the simple beep of a text message is just the right impulse. A simple ""L.O.L."" is all it takes to ruin their young lives. A few short words could potentially take the premature life of someone all because there hasn't been any real steps taken to not allow this.

In conclusion, cellphones' grasps on the world is one that is hard to deny or shake. Many individuals have even become addicted to their devices. This addiction has caused a grave number of problems for the world such as accidents, car wrecks and even death in some cases. These tragedies have heavily impacted our youth as they are some of the most at risk an afflicted. These young people are our next generation and we should try our best to protect and guide their lives to the greatness they can achieve. Therefore, cellphones should not be used while driving.",1
"Use cellphone and driving

In 2018 there were 1.6 million crashes annually from cellphones and driving. Cellphones are the lead factor that's caused accidents. Many accidents come from teens using their phones while driving. For an example they can create dangerous, and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident .For this reason cellphones should not be used while driving.

One reason why using phones and driving because when bad accidents takes instance people or teens lives.

they are also ruining people life like making people can't walk again, forget how to do things like walk, and, eat. Lots of people diening because of these cellphones calls or messages.

your cellphone can wait until you get to the place to see what the notification is. Caused too many car crashes to happen.

when teens phone are in the car and they get a notification. Teens are so anxious to see calls or sent a text.

Therefore, they should ban the cellphones completely while driving for the safety of everyone. When teens try to do two things at once. Multitask caused its them to have an accident quicker than a regular accident. Whatever the emergency, always wait until they stop or get to their destination.

My answer for teens is tempted to text and drive therefore they should not use cellphones while driving. Or have a phone in their surroundings. Banning cellphones while driving is for the safety of everyone. If so we wouldn't lose as many teenagers lives to tweets, texts and phone calls.",1
"Just Put It Down!

I wondered if anyone ever thinks that cell phones would become a way of life. I wondered if anyone has ever been told that talking or texting on a cell phone while driving could be your last call or text to anyone. Cell phones are our way to communicate. Without cell phones we don't feel important. Cell phones and driving allows people to show off to their friends while driving.

If a cell phone can easily distract a person while driving than why are they in such big demand?

Cell phones and driving just don't go hand and hand. If you turn on the television there is somebody talking about the best cell phone company in America. Telephone companies should have some responsibility when it comes down to texting and driving. The telephone companies have commercials that make a person feel like they have to have the latest phone, with the latest techniques, and the best 5G plan. If people would just sit back and look at how my grandma said she wrote and visited family members growing up in the country. Do you know how far a country mile is from my house? A country mile is a long way. It would take me at least an hour to get from my house to my grandma's house in Columbus, Georgia. If I wanted to go to my grandma's house in Albany, Georgia I would be walking for at least two days or longer to get where I am going.

If cell phones are so great why anyone hasn't came up with a device to turn the cell phone off automatically when driving. Now that would be technology in the making! If telephone companies and car manufactures could come up with a smart car that would be something to drive. Just imagine riding down the road and you have to call your friend to let him know you just saw his girl riding wither mom in the car right next to him. All of a certain the cell phone goes completely dead when you try to text or make a phone call. There is no sound and no light on your cell phone. Technology would be great if that would happen while someone is driving and texting or talking on the cell phone, the phone goes completely dead.

2020 has proven to be one of those years we'll never forget. The texting and cell phone law went into affect in2019 and I still see people driving and talking. The law is supposed to punish those people holding a hand device like a phone in their hands while driving.

It's funny, the same people who are enforcing the law the police are the one's driving and holding a held hand device in their hands while on duty. Well, I see the police are the ones breaking the law by holding a hand held device while driving. . So, who is supposed to enforce the law that we cannot have any mobile device in our hands while driving if the policies breaking the law as well? I guess that is left up to anyone who wants to follow the law. People are dying each and every day from texting and driving. It's simple, just drive and talk later. I know people are going to say, ""I'm letting my friend know I am on the way."" Didn't you just call your friend to let them know you are on the way before you left the house? I feel that laws are made for a reason and they should not be broken by anyone. If no one is following the law than why do we have a law?

It would be so simple to just put the phone down and drive. Simple to just put the hand held devices down and drive in order to save lives. JUST PUT IT DOWN!",1
"SHOULD PEOPLE DRIVE WITH THEIR CELLPHONE OR NOT?

We all love our phones now a days and basically ever since they were invented. Everyone has one or wants one or the newest latest one .Ever since they were invented in 1700s people have taken the full advantage of the telephone presidents and war sargents used them to win battles and etc. Now the phone has evolved from tube looking phones to brick phones to flip phones to iphones and to smartphones. With all the new technology and apps like facetime snapchat3 games music social media there's almost no way anyone could ever put their phones down. But according to statistics in 2013 about 3,154 people died in accidents 424,000 were injured. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.

So the question stands do we need to drive while on your cellphone? With all the crashes maybe we should drive without our phones but with the increments in technology we mind as well just use them cars are able to call people just like phones, so if you can call people in your car and be distracted anyways when your calling whom ever. There putting almost smartphones in the car so you can most defiantly be distracted with that. The fact that they are and already are making cars able to drive by themselves is anther reason that is very distracting just as in Tulsa the electrically powered car has pilot mode so it drives itself. So many people have been distracted from the road and driving because the car can drive itself even though the car can drive itself you still need to pay attention to the road.

I do understand that you don't need to be looking down when driving and I do understand that phones are distracting. So you picking up a cellphone and calling someone can be distracting. Also like I said in another essay I did there is a responsibility factor to firstly own a car and secondly to even own a phone. It might seem like it is not a responsibility owning a phone but it is when you own a phone you have personal information in it. If you were lose your phone and have never put a password or security code on it you can lose your information to whoever has your phone could be a hacker could be a random thieve.

So really my answer is that it really depends on your responsibility level if you can't stay off your phone and it's life then you need to let someone drive but if you can be responsible while driving then I'd say you should us your phone responsibly. Cause if you drive irresponsibly you should have your phone.",1
"Texting and Driving

Cellphone is the most used technology in everyone's everyday life wherever they go they have to bring their cellphones. Phones was a great invention that it helps people communicate anywhere and call anyone anywhere which is a good technology that can help people in everyday life. But Phones are the reason a lot of teens get into car accidents and can cause people's lives.

Texting and driving is one of the causes of car crashes this recent years, where the driver gets distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead of them. One of the articles I've looked up stated that ""Studies show that approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their cell phones while driving every day. While this number includes people who are texting, it also includes people who are checking their email, making, receiving or checking phone calls and using mobile apps"" (""Texting While Driving""). This shows that a lot of people who are driving text and can endanger their lives and other peoples. As most people think that a lot of car accidents are caused by drunk people or people speeding the article ""The Real Reason You Shouldn't Text While Driving"" stated that

""The most frequent driver mistake is ""recognition error,"" which encompasses ""driver's inattention, internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance."" In other words, most crashes are not caused by flagrantly intoxicated people, nor that aggressive driver who will do whatever it takes to get to their destination one minute earlier. Most crashes are caused by people like you and me who think they can pay attention to the road and do something else at the same time."" this shows that texting and driving is out of control and is dangerous for everyone who drive and text even though people know how dangerous it is, they still do it thats why states decided to ban texting and driving to stop people from texting while driving and stopping them from doing it.

In conclusion that people should take the law about texting while driving to stop the car accidents so they are less deaths and injuries due to texting while driving.

"Phones and Driving

Many people have the bad habit of using their cell phones while they're driving every time they step into a car to drive somewhere. Both teens and adults have this habit and most drivers are aware that it is not a good habit to have. They could be texting people, calling people, getting on social media, etc. However, using a cell phone while driving is a huge distraction to the driver which is why it is such a bad habit to have. There are plenty of reasons as to why people should not use their phone while they're driving and why it's so dangerous to do so. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.

Since some people go on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident. If a person causes a car accident because of being on their phone, it can cause harm and even death to the driver, the passengers in the driver's car, other people driving on the road, and even pedestrians. There are many handfree ways to use a cell phone while driving instead of having the phone in the hand of the driver. According to a website called driving-tests. org, it states, ""Hands-free technology is easy to use and widely available."" An example of a hands-free technology that people can easily use would be a phone holder. With phone holders, people can place their phone in the phone holder on the dashboard so they can answer phone calls, use their GPS, etc. If the people with the bad habit of using their phones while driving get a phone holder, it would decrease the chances of getting into a car accident which will benefit everyone.

Being on the phone while driving not only is very dangerous and unsafe, it is illegal in most states to have a mobile device in the hands on a driver. Having a mobile device in the hands of a driver at any age is illegal in 10 states while having a mobile device in the hands of a novice driver is illegal in 32 states. Since it is illegal in most states, the consequences could be getting a ticket, having to pay a fine, or possibly getting some jail time. There is a website called araglegal. com, and on the website it says, ""Texting and driving makes a crash up to 23 times more likely."" That is the reason it is illegal to even have a phone in the hand of a driver in some states because it results in bad consequences. To avoid bad consequences from happening, drivers can be smart to not even touch their phone while they're driving, they could easily pull over to use their phone instead of using it while driving, etc.

Many adults use their cellular device while they're driving and sometimes, they even do it with their kids in the car. Doing that sets a bad example and gives a horrible influence on kids.

When kids grow up and learn how to drive, they might use their phone while they're driving because they're going to think that it's okay since their parents did the same exact thing.

According to ""4 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Text and Drive,"" it states, ""Why wouldn't young drivers think it's okay to text and drive? They've seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents."" That quote from the website explains the mindset of a young driver perfectly; Having this mindset as a young driver is not good to have because it can cause multiple consequences for them. So if adults don't use their phone while they're driving, especially when their kids are in the car, young drivers will make the smart decision and not be on their device while driving.

Almost everyone knows that it's dangerous to be on the phone while they're driving but people still do it regardless. It would make the world so much easier if people stayed off their phones while driving because there wouldn't be as many car accidents happening. Every driver needs to think about what would happen if they caused a car accident just because they were on their phone and driving at the same time. If someone caused a car accident because they were paying attention to their phone and not the road, and someone died, the person that caused the accident would feel so guilty. In conclusion, every driver needs to know the dangers of being on their phone while driving and why they shouldn't do it so there can be less car accidents. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.",1
"Phones and Driving

In America today, drivers make mistakes, because they choose to operate their cell phones while driving. These mistakes range from drivers running through traffic lights or stop signs, to them actually colliding with pedestrians or other vehicles. People should not operate their cell phones while driving, because doing so is distracting, and can lead to unfortunate occurrences. When people operate their phones while driving, they are at risk of: insurance rates increase, being involved in an automobile accident, and being punished for negligent driving.

One reason people should not use cell phones while driving is because this can lead to insurance rate increases. Receiving citations can have an effect on insurance rate. For example, when a driver runs through a traffic light or stop sign and receives a citation by law enforcement, this information is generally reported to the driver's insurance company. This possibly effect males differently than females. According to Isabel Prontes, ""Young men under the age of twenty-five generally pay higher auto insurance rates than young women"" (https://pocketsense. com>. Likewise, a driver's insurance rate will very likely increase when they have an accident. If the driver is at fault of the accident, then they have to pay for damages done to the number of vehicles that was involved. Since Georgia has passed the law banning cell phone operation while driving; frequently, there are victims who continue to break this law, and eventually get caught. Receiving citations (tickets) causes an increase in drivers' automobile insurance rates.

Furthermore, there are many incidents that can occur when drivers operate their cell phones while driving. If an individual is walking/ jogging, and a driver ends up hitting the pedestrian with the vehicle, this mishap occurred due to negligent driving. Moreover, some drivers run into other vehicles because they are operating their phones while behind the wheel, instead of being attentive to their driving. In addition, some people actually are on their phone, not realizing that they are pulling out in front of another vehicle, causing an accident as a result. Law enforcement suggests that drivers pull over before tampering with their phone or those drivers should wait until they reach their destination before engaging in phone use. Some accidents (due to cell phone use while driving) are even fatal.

Finally, there are punishments that should be mandated for negligent driving due to cellphone operation while driving. One punishment could be major fines increase for all violators. In addition, negligent drivers should have to face jail time for this offense, particularly when the violator is found guilty of vehicular homicide. Undeniably, no amount of money can replace a life. However, drivers should be held accountable when they do not drive responsibly.

This essay has informed you on why it is not safe to be on phones and drive. Honestly, I do not agree with phone operation while driving, because, of the amount of fatalities that has happened, and also now in Georgia, cell phone use while driving is illegal. Cell phone operation while driving is still a major problem in the United States, subjecting citizens to the risks of: insurance rate increases being involved in an automobile, and being punished for negligent driving. Constantly, emergency personnel are racing up and down the highway, responding to accidents caused by cell phone operation while driving. People are trying to figure out how to prevent victims from operating their phones while driving by putting hands free phone devices and navigation systems in vehicles. Yet adults and children are still dying, because of phone use while driving. Maybe one day a philosopher will come up with a great invention that will prevent the injuries and deaths of more victims.",1
"Why phones should be banned

In a technologically advanced world like the one we currently live in it is easy for us to get caught up in our cell phones. Text, email, and social media link together all of your friends and family in one handheld device. With all these things we can do at the touch of a button it can be hard to put the phone down, especially while driving. What most drivers don't know is that cell phones contribute to a high percentage of deaths and car accidents in teen and adult drivers.

First, based on a survey conducted by the cdc ""Each day in the united states approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver."" This is an amazing statistic, out of the millions of people living in our country, thousands are getting killed and injured by simply looking at a text. Such a little task and it cost them their life.

Next, in a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the average driver is distracted by a text for 5 seconds, at 55 miles per hour you can travel the length of a football field. Imagine the amount of stuff that could happen in the length of a football field. Deer, pedestrians, sharp turns, you name it, and if you are distracted by a cell phone you could end up hurt, or worse dead.

So is that text message really that important? Can't it wait until the next stop? If you feel the need to check your phone i will tell you that waiting is the better option. If you check it right away you could end up as just another statistic and victim of distracted driving.

"Phones and Driving

Is your phone or life more important? This is a frequently asked question for people that are so consumed by their phones while driving. As much as technology is a great essential to everyday life it is a huge threat to our lives especially while driving. People will always say ""It's fine I won't crash!"" Then boom one reply to a text that could've been sent when you have reached somewhere safe has taken your life. I want to speak on the importance of not texting while driving or just being on your phone at all, because it can save the lives of many.

I believe that people should not be able to operate a phone at all while driving a vehicle, because not only are you putting your life in danger, you're putting someone else's life in danger as well. ""Reported by the National Safety Council that cell phone use while driving causes 1.6 million crashes each year."" In society people will point the finger to teenagers, but what the world must understand is that everyone plays a big role in this destruction.

Law enforcement officials have tried to crack down on the problem of texting and driving or just occupying a phone in general. This is very hard because they're people out there that use their phones to navigate where they're going but this could also be a distraction. Also, a police officer can't catch every person that they see using a phone while driving and it's not legal to just suspect and pull someone and ask them for their phone. So, in that case there is not much law enforcement officials can do. I believe that law officials should give people warnings and if a car accident is caused by someone not paying attention to the road they should be arrested, because they're putting someone else's life in danger as much as their own. Driving classes that prepare you to take on the road should talk about this subject more and show the numbers of people being killed from accidents caused by phones. If we really want this problem to stop, we as people need to spread awareness on this topic!

Never know what can happen you might pass a red light and cause an accident. Phones shouldn't be use for texting nor calling but you can use it to get somewhere. In case you don't know where it is you can use your gps but that's it.

Reasons why you shouldn't use your cellphone. To begin with it's against the law to text and drive. Secondly, you can cause an accident you never know what can happen when you don't pay attention.

"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving.

Due to many statistics and other research cellular devices are the main causes of car accidents. Many scientists have proven to us that cellphones put drivers at a very great risk of getting into a wreck. Even with this information drivers still choose to use there phone behind the wheel. Drivers have even resulted to using hand free devices, because they think that this is safer. Some people use the excuse that ""If there's an emergency they may need there cellular device"" to support the face of using their phone behind the wheel. There's a lot of evidence to support why drivers should not use their phone behind the wheel.

When driving it's very hard to focus on both the road and your phone. It's very easy to forget that your sharing the road with other people. Other people on take notice to drivers being on the cellular devices even if they don't want to or not because of the hazards they create. Texting while driving is the more dangerous than talking while driving. You take your eyes off the road for one minute and boom you've gotten into a wreck.

Most of the drivers that fall into this category are teens. These drivers have the highest fatalities behind the wheel due to using a phone. In the state of Utah using your phone behind the wheel , and you cause an accident it can land you in jail for up to 15 years. Most teens use airpods made by Apple inc, instead of holding the phone in there hand. This is even more dangerous because you can't hear your surroundings.

In conclusion: if people continue to use there cellular devices behind the wheel he number of casualties on the roads they will continue to increase.. It is the people's responsibility to not put their own and others people lives at risk due to there horrible actions.",1
"People should not be able to use cell phone while they are driving in any capacity. The reasons they should not be allowed to use them is because they could seriously hurt someone or kill them when they are using their cell phones. When you are using a cell phone while operating a vehicle you are paying attention to the phone rather than the road.

Let's say you were using your phone and you hit somebody and killed them what would you do. You would probably drive off and then call the police but if you did do that then they would check traffic cameras and the get your license plate and you would go to jail for a hit and run charge. But if you stay then you're going to either get a ticket for distracted driving or you could go to jail on a manslaughter charge so its up to you on what you do.",1
"Across the country, most states have laws prohibiting the use of cell phones while driving. Research shows that cell phone use while driving significantly increases the chance of getting into an accident. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in teenagers because a majority of them are distracted drivers. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction. For example, taking your eyes off the road to read a text or something of that sort it increases the risk of you crashing, driving of the road, etc...Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is setup. Drivers use of cell phones while vehicles are in motion should be prohibited because it is a vision distractor, it is law enforced, and it is a hazard to other drivers and passengers. This topic is very important in today's society because cell phones have become a significant issue on the roadway. However, cell phones and driving have become a massive issue that has redoubled these past years. Everybody has their own point of view; however I believe that using cell phones while driving should not be allowed.",1
"Phones and driving

I think people should and shouldn't use their phones while driving. I think people who drive and pay more attention to their phones should be arrested and have their lisecen taken away because the could cause crashes , deaths and traffic . the most common death in America is car crashes because of stupid drivers and people looking at their phone while driving. Now the reason I say people should have their phones is in case of emergency like if they get in a car crash or if they have to call 911 to help someone. in the u. s. it is a law that you have to have your phone down from your hands while driving or at least have a Bluetooth device that can connect to your phone to your car so you don't have to look at your phone to call or answer a call while your driving a car . so I'm both with and against with this argument about if drivers should and shouldn't have their phones while driving",1
"Should or Shouldn't people use their phones while driving?

What my opinion on this topic is no and the reason why I say this because people (mostly teenagers) can't focus when they have a phone in the car, they will keep using it which causes them to get distracted like for example in a BBC article they estimated that all 6% of car accidents happen because people were on their mobile phones this also means that 12,000 serious injuries and 2,600 deaths each year in the U.S. And on the news on April 8, 2019, a teen who was speeding at 106 mph while on the social media app Snapchat got in a car accident with her friend but because she was paying attention got her friend killed and now that teen will be faced with 15 years in prison and many more like this happened to teens, adults, elders, etc.

Because of them using their mobile phones while driving and not paying attention to the road.

Therefore, I say that people shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving hands-free or not because it causes a lot of accidents each year and if we don't act fast then we will just keep losing the ones we love.",1
"Phones and Driving essay

The rate of of people dying in automobiles has increased 300% because of people using their phones while driving. Using a phone while driving should NOT even be debatable. The consequences that could come with that are way too dangerous. It could cause distractions, an accident or even worse, death. Being in any of those situations could be very harmful not just to you but the others in the car with you. The government should get involved by making laws.

Using phones while driving should be illegal everywhere.

To begin with, using your phone while driving could cause a distraction. For example, if you're driving and there's an ambulance or a police officer trying to get through because of an emergency, the driver may not hear or see the sirens because they are distracted on their phone. Someone could be critical conditions in the ambulance but can't get the hospital because of the person that's distracted on their phone. Sometimes you have to use your phone for an emergency. Just wait till you get to your destination. Cell phone distractions can also cause problems to a pedestrian or even a driver that is swerving. Being distracted by a cell phone is similar to being drunk and driving.

Another consequence that it could have is an accident could occur. It could be the slightest accident but its still considered an accident. Which means someone has to call the cops to report the accident and the cop will take at least 45-60 minutes just to arrive which is a waste of time and money because if it was your fault your insurance cost rise up 60+ more a month. Depending on what the driver already pays it could be way more. That's just for a slight accident. All of that for using your mobile device.

Last but not least, the use of your phone while driving can cause death. The driver could be so distracted that they are unaware of how fast they are driving. If you get into a head on accident at a high speed it can cause death or even crashing into a tree at high speed it can do the same. If you have others in the car with you, you're putting others lives at danger. That could affect the people that love you and love them as well. All of that because you forgot to shoot someone a text back.

Yes, we get it, sometimes using your phone while you're driving is needed for an emergency. Don't just use it to text your friends back or to put music on. Do all that before you take off. Because remember all the bad things that could happen just for using your phone while driving. Keep your eyes on the road.",1
"Phones and Driving

Drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers may need to use their phones in order to know how to get where they're going. There might also be an emergency in which the driver needs to use his/her phone to call for help. While drivers shouldn't be scrolling through social media while driving, they should be able to use their phones as needed.

Drivers use their phones as a gps device to figure out how to get to their desired location. Studies show that only seven percent of the 220 million cars in the United States have a built in gps navigation system. This means that drivers must find another way to get directions. The maps app on their phone not only gives directions, but it reads the directions out loud so that the driver is not staring at their screen while driving. Using a phone as navigation while driving is the safest alternative to having a built in car gps.

Furthermore, drivers need to use their phones to call for help in the case of an emergency. Emergencies are bound to happen, especially while you're operating a vehicle. Today's technology allows drivers to make calls using limited screen time and/or voice activation. This gives drivers access to using their phones while driving without causing them to take their eyes off the road. Having access to make emergency calls while operating a vehicle can help save the lives of many drivers and their passengers.

Some might argue that drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. However, every driver at one point or another is going to use their phone while driving. Regardless of the reason, it is inevitible. While drivers should not be scrolling through social media and sending texts while behind the wheel, they should have the right to make emergency calls and use gps through their phones. Drivers should be given limited access to their phones while driving.

All in all, drivers should be given the right to use their phones while operating a vehicle. Phones can be used by drivers as a navigation system to help them get places safely. Phones can also be used to make calls in case of emergencies. All things considered, drivers should be allowed to use their phones to a certain extent while driving.

"Phones and Driving

Although Cell Phones are pretty useful it does not mean that people should be glued on to it the whole time. They may help connect one another, but at some points, the phone has to be put down. Such as when someone is doing tasks that need them to be focused. For example, driving needs the person driving to be all the way focused. Although most people may tend to use their phones for a GPS system most cars in this modern day have a GPS system within it. Phones should not be used in driving because of less attention on the road, setting a bad example for young children, and it is worse than driving under the influence.

First of all, cell phones are a Manual distraction. This means that the tasks that require the driver to take a hand off the steering wheel and manipulate a device. (Hilbert 24) Due to this, the driver is more distracted and unsafe when driving. According to the text ""This inventory highlighted aspects of equipment designs that could affect driver distraction.""(Hilbert 30) This means that the driver would spend more time looking at a screen than on the road. As stated by the author, ""Cellular phones, and other in-vehicle distractions, force drivers to divide their limited attentional resources among tasks, thereby focusing less of their attention on driving."" (Delashmit 160)

Phones may still be useful for people but less time looking at the road is still not a good thing and could set a bad example for younger children.

Secondly, children have a developing mind. Meaning that certain events may scar them for life. They may even think that it is okay to be on the phone. As it states in the text "" For example, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in collaboration with NHTSA, found that driver inattention was involved in 80 percent of all vehicle crashes (65 percent of near-crashes)."" (Delashmit 150) If a parent or older sibling, while a child is in a car, is on the phone when driving then they are more likely to be distracted from the road and crash. The younger people are trusting the person who is driving and if there were to be an accident then it could start the development to a mental health disorder. As stated by the author ""These implications highlight the degree to which a child or adolescent is likely to be involved, witness or experience a crash or the consequences of a crash and therefore be subjected to any number of physical injuries or psychological disorders.""(Greydanus 92) If it was not bad enough driving under the influence is a little like worse then spending eighty percent of the time on the phone while driving.

Finally, although driving under the influence is bad, it is still not worse then spending more time looking on the phone then on the road. As stated in the text ""The public does not appear to be as cognizant of this social responsibility aspect, as distinct from personal risk, for in-vehicle technology use, compared to alcohol.""(Hilbert 153) This meaning that driving under the influence is not as bad as being on the phone.

A test was conducted to see how drivers would drive under the influence or on the phone. The results where ""Some studies of cell phone use have compared the degradation of performance to some level of alcohol impairment. Strayer, Drews, & Crouch (2006), for example, found in a study of simulated driving that drivers using cell phones had elevated crash risks similar to those of drivers with blood alcohol concentrations of approximately .08 g/dL, though the specific impairments of each group differed."" This test showed that there were more accidents with being on the phone than driving under the influence.

Although some may say that having the phone out is okay seeing as it is used for navigation. There are laws in place for driving and having a cellular device. As stated by the text ""These laws take several forms: Some require drivers to use a hands-free device if they want to talk on the phone, some prohibit younger or less experienced drivers from using any type of cell phone, and some allow officers to cite drivers for using a handheld cell phone if the driver is pulled over for another offense.""(Guerin 163) As shown they only get in trouble or is only bad if they have it in their hand only if they get pulled over and the officer sees it in their hand. Driving while on the phone is not bad.

In conclusion, phones and driving is not that good. It puts the risk of lives on the line. It causes more vehicle accidents on the road than any other distraction. Although it maybe be handy to help navigate it still should not be used eighty percent of the time while on the road. It sets a bad example for children. It is still slightly worse then driving under the influence. Driving and having a phone out is bad.

In 2015, the United States started to focus on the problem that was phone use while driving. Distracted driving has taken many innocent lives. According to enddd. com 37,416 lives were lost in 2016 due to distracted driving. No matter how much the death rate rises people still use their phones while operating a vehicle. Most people have the argument that having a phone mounted so they could have two hands on the wheel eliminates the problem. However, the level of danger is still high. There are opinions that the use of cell phones while driving have little to no negative effects, but there is much more compelling evidence that it is a serious hazard to be distracted while driving.

While driving with other motorist around, it is imperative to keep all focus on the road. The smallest mistake could lead to a major accident including people that were not involved. In 2012 alone, 3,328 people were killed in distracted driving crashes, a number that continues to go up (Distraction. Gov). As technology advances they rate of distracted driving increasing. It has been uncovered that people between the ages of 18 and 25 have the highest rates of distracted driving. Text messaging creates a crash risk 23 times worse than driving while not distracted (Distraction. Gov).

On the contrary, it is understood that a phone might need to be used in a state of emergency. However, answering to an emergency can cause one of your own. Imagine being in a state of panic and stress with the addition of cell phone use while driving. Now there is another state of peril. It's better to get to the emergency than not getting there at all.

In conclusion, people are still being severely injured and even killed because of drivers distracted by phones. People walk through and across the streets scared for their lives, wondering if they will make it to their destination. How many deaths must occur before people realize how dangerous their actions can be? No one will ever know the real answer How many children are going to have to lose their parents, or for that matter, how many parents are going to have to lose their children before this danger can be stopped? No one will ever know the answer. All that can be done, as of now, is to try the best ways that can be done.",1
"Explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

PROPER_NAME

People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

There are several reasons why and I will be discussing two of them. Cell phones are a convience to our society, but there should be a time and place for them to be used.

First, cell phones are a benefit and allows everyone to have access to a telephone at all times of the day.

Kids, teenagers, adults, even grandparents have cell phones.

As you pay attention to people that you pass by whether it's in traffic or walking, there is a cell phone in toat.

While riding a bike, people are on the phone.

While driving cars, people are on the phone.

While sitting waiting for a bus, people are on the phone.

Even while people are walking they are on the phone.

Do they get any break?

The phone that is?

With all of this phone use where is the focus of the individual?

Individual focus does not exist when everyone is on their cell phone.

Whether they are looking at the weather, SnapChat, Facebook, or Instagram, they are still not focused on their surroundings.

With the lack of focus there have been more accidents and deaths.

Accidents occur when you are distracted and death can easily follow.

While driving the attention needs to be on the road.

There have been documentaries where those that have lost loved ones due to inappropriate cell phone use read the last message that was sent or the last words that they user said.

Many times that call or message wasn't that important and could have waited.

Overall, individuals should not use cell phones while driving.

They cause distraction and lack of focus.

Many lives could be saved if people weren't careful about their cell phone usage.",1
"In today's world, almost everyone has a smart phone. People should not use their phones while driving because phones are known for being a distraction. Moreover, consider your passengers. Also it is Illegal to use your phone. People do not understand the risk they put themselves in. The most dangers place to use it is in the car.

Using the phone while driving is one of the leading cause of death in America. Phones are supposed to help make communication easier, but instead using it causes a distraction. When the phone vibrates, the driver normally looks down at the phone to see what notification they just received. By checking the phone, everything can go wrong in the seconds it takes the driver to check.

It can cause an accident and it takes up to much time and money to fix the car. Not all accidents end lightly like some accidents can kill people.

The passengers also need to feel safe and conferrable in the car. If the driver is using their phone while driving with the passenger(s) and the driver gets into a wreck, not only does the driver get hurt but also dose the passenger(s). Sometimes the wrecks can get horrible and neither of them make it out alive. Other times the driver makes it and the passenger(s) do not. It is also possible that the passenger(s) could get nervous, reacted in a bad way, and make the situation a lot worse. Sometimes people do not realize how things can go from good, too bad, too worse in a couple of seconds.

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use the phone while in the car. They put the hands free law. Now drivers can no longer have phones ""touching any part of their body"". If the driver is stopped by a cop, and they are on their phone. They face a $50 fine and goes up every time the cop stopes them. Georgia is the 16th state to pass such a hands-free law.

People need to understand that phones are dangerous. They are a distraction and they are a safety issue. If people do not know how to control themselves and not use it then the law was rightfully placed. People kill others and die every day because of them not paying attention to the rode. Driving is like a war because its life or death.",1
"Phones & Driving

Smart phones have not been around for a very long time , but they have hugely impacted today's society. People can literally use their phones for anything which is not good , because it has become an addiction for many people. They are using them at the wrong times and of them is while driving. People are so focused on their phones that they risk their safety and others safety everyday. 1 reason that it's bad is because you can't pay attention to the road which can cause accidents and driving with 1 hand is not easy. This a very big hazzard that can be stopped , but people would rather be on their phones.

The National Safety Council report that cell phone use while drivng leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries are caused from texting while driving. This is not good. Too many people are being hurt and some are even killed from these fatal car crashes. The regulations must be changed because this is making the roads unsafe. People should not have to worry about if their life is in danger or not because someone is in on their phone.

In conclusion Phones and Driving isn't safe and it should not be permitted.

The Risk is very high and too many people are being hurt by the situation. We should try to fix this problem as soon as possible.",1
"The notion that cell phones should be used while on the road is very disturbing and quiet unacceptable. Recent studies show that cell phones on the phone increase the potential rate of brain tumors. If your distracted on the road, Car accidents may happen. Things could go wrong leaving you with unnecessary money spent and heavy bills.

These are the factors that have lead up to cell phones not being a good decision when it comes to safety and driving on the road.

In this day and age, mobile phones have become very addictive and hard to put down. While young teens drive on the road, all the focus often tends to go to a snapchat or Instagram post, not only do addictive habits lead to car accidents but students will also see a downfall in studies and other extra circular activates. Phones can often be helpful for the use of gps and other driving apps but could cause a huge accident if not handled by the right person.

Due to the brightness of the phone, it often leads to health issues, Long hours of your eyes being exposed to the screen could lead to temporary loss of sight witch is never good. Also, headaches occur when most people are on the phone to much long hours often affect the ears witch leads to more problems occurring then normal. Scientist have shown that the more time we spend on our phones the more time are bodies are being affected. Things like slouching or leaning could lead to permit neck issues and back sprains.

When your addicted to a phone driving and using the phone becomes a very hard. There is a new law in Georgia that says if you on on your phone while you are driving you will receive a ticket. Which is a good law and one that was very needed. There should be a law for that everywhere in the united states to help drivers so that they can avoid car accidents.

In conclusion, these are the factors that have lead up to phones on the road being a huge mistake.",1
"Teen's Driving with Phones

Teens should not be on their phones while driving it is dangerous. When driving all you attention should be on what's in front of you not what's on your phone. That split second look down at your phone could be fatal, cause you don't know what's going on around you and you could hit someone or run off the road. In some states it's against the law to drive while on your phone, the consequences are severe and could handicap you from some jobs.

Driving with a phone is not okay unless it's being used as a navigation tool. Texting and driving isn't something that should be common it's a distraction . Calling is okay if its hands free calling and you can still stay focused on the road and talk at the same time. Things will not change teens are still going to disobey what the law says and drive with their phones in hand without a care in the world unless the law enforcement cracks down on it.

All in all teens should not be driving with the possession of their phone. The ,aw should crack down and make it harder for kids to drive on the phone.",1
"Phones & Driving

There is a growing discussion debating whether people should be able to use their phone while driving or not be able to. Considering there's an average increase in car accidents since phones added all the features to text,games or watch movies but the phone is also a good access for people to navigate to their destination by wia gps. To continue with those topics people shouldnt be able to use their Device whether it's in hands free mode or not. It's too dangerous and a big risk.

Although, Having a phone can result in car accidents it most definitely helps when it comes to the navigation factor of trying to get to your destination. Whether it's the gps notify the driver there is another car accident ahead or heavy traffic. The end result which convinces most of the argument to side with the phone is that it helps the driver get to their destination faster.

Even Though, phones make it such a difficult topic to debate whether people should even be allowed to have phones on while driving but again not only do they help with getting to your destination quicker but it also can make people business better a lot of people answer the phone in the car and most of all those car have hand free mode which technically make the phone safer. ALthough phones get you yo your destination quicker it also has gotten so bad that the law made it illegal as stated "" Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdiction has made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal"".

Also , On the other hand it was found cars with the hands free mode are as dangerous if your device is on hand on mode which gets this argument rolling the article found states; "" the obvious implication is that hands-free phone calls may be almost as dangerous as a hand-held call. This danger is less obvious to the public, especially as a ban on hand-held calls can be seen to support the ""safer"" hands-free alternative"".(David Crundall)

To conclude, Driving with hand free mode can be equivalent to having hand held while driving but considering the quote/article from David crundall it proves people shouldn't be able to use their Device whether it's in hands free mode or not. It's too dangerous and a big risk.",1
"Required Essay: Phones & Driving

Cell phones were introduced in the United States in 1980 by engineer Martin Cooper. Since then cell phones have grown massively. More than 65% of Americans operate a cell phone. One main reason for the growth of popularity is that cell phones give us the ability to reach any person in a matter of seconds almost effortlessly. The technology of the cell phone has dramatically changed, for example Apple and their extraordinary enhancements to their devices over time. Cell phones are a necessity but not before your life or anyone else's. More than 1.5 million deaths occur a year due to cell phone use while driving. Cell phones should never in any case be more important than the road while you are driving. Drivers should definitely know to never use cell phones while driving, especially for a text.

Cell Phones provide communication with convenience, but they also have many other perks including cameras,games, etc. Cell phones can have many different uses, all of which can be very useful but at the right time. There are multiple ways in which a driver can be distracted while driving. They include talking to passengers, lighting up a cigarette and smoking,eating and drinking, etc. None of these have caused more deaths than distraction by cell phone in the USA. It is important to note that distracted driver attention by mobile phones means driving and talking at the same time, which raises safety threats. Drivers have to control both the vehicle and the mobile phone which makes focusing on the road a lot more difficult.

Drivers who use cell phones while driving not only endangers themselves but also other people on the road. As a result, most governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland and many more have created strict policies on phone use during driving. Due to lack of attention, drivers react slowly to traffic signals, sometimes missing. Decision making during driving is very important. Being distracted gives drivers a fraction of a second to make a quick decision in an intense scenario. Studies have highlighted that cell phone drivers react a lot slower and are more likely to make a mistake on the road.

Due to the statistics it can be concluded that, despite being a revolutionary way of communication, the use of cell phones during driving distracts the attention of the driver dramatically and puts lives at risk.",1
"Phones and Driving

First, cell phones and humans are like a duo and used by them almost every day. Humans and cars are also another duo or like a duo. But, people phones and cars and or driving? That personally is not a good idea. That is what I will be explaining in this essay. Is it or it is not a good idea to be texting and driving at the same time? Many different opinions from different people but, here is mine.

Next, have you ever been on a road with more than one lane and the person next to you is looking down on their device? Ask yourself do you think that is safe? Operating a cell phone is okay, and is done on a daily basis. People often think that since they have been texting and driving for long periods of time that they are experts and can do it with no problem. When in reality anything can happen at any moment you look down at your device, and it is certainly not safe.

Then, one of the number one causes of death in the world is car accidents. Usually it comes from texting and driving or even a drunk driver. Texting and driving is not safe and people should NOT be able to operate a vehicle and use cell phones. Why? Because, people die every day from a car accident either because of a device or drinking and driving. I believe that it will decrease the number of crashes and save many lives.

Therefore, Driving and texting should not be allowed. Very dangerous and you have a high risk of losing your life and others in your car and around your car. If you are in a vehicle your phone should not even be your main focus, because the road should have all of your attention. It is better to be safe than sorry on the road, and help prevent many accidents.

In conclusion,

I think phones and driving should NOT happen together. I mean as in texting and driving at the same time. It has been a law but is barely followed by anyone. Many people will still text and drive but, for people who care about other they will follow this law. Maybe even one day they will prevent someone else from losing their life.",1
"Phones were created to alert people if a crisis were about to begin or to contact loved ones from far away for long periods. Over the years, phones have since upgraded into cell phones that can fit anywhere. They are very efficient and much lighter to carry around. Cell Phones nowadays help get minds off of certain things that disturb daily lives by entertaining the brain. Some people argue that cell phones help with safety issues but that's far from the truth because cell phones lead to serious accidents and communication problems on the road.

Without a doubt, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones on the road because it causes a lack of focus and leads to serious accidents. This is a major issue since drivers are usually on their phones all the time. For example, ""the major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts the attention of the driver"" (Scotti, 2007). This leads to putting the passenger at risk of injury. Along the same lines, this can be very dangerous if the driver has earbuds in his or her ear. For instance, ""cell phones reduce the driver's performance""(Gravelle, 2005). The driver can be impaired and no longer able to hear what's going on, which can lead to confusion on the roads and cause the driver to make the wrong turn.

Some may argue that texting while driving is dangerous and may lead to serious injuries but, that's the opposite. Texting has proven to be the quickest way of getting work finished without having to be in the office or the school building. It's a great help with accessing the shops online rather than using a map. For example, ""using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic"" (Sturnguist, 2006). In the same way, this makes it easier to decide on what outfit to wear that day. Not only does it help with weather issues it can also help with navigating the quickest way from accidents. However, driving while having a cellphone in hand is still against the law, and can lead to suspension or worse jail time. People on the road believe that if they wear their seatbelt, it can protect them from accidents but this is only half correct. It provides the passenger with somewhat of a small chance of protection but a higher risk with or without it on. Studies have highlighted that ""drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decisions causing serious accidents involving other vehicles"" (Gravelle, 2005). This is the main reason why cell phones shouldn't be in your hands while driving. As an example, especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation and pay less attention to these areas, increasing the risk of fatal accidents.

(Gravelle, 2005) Along the same lines, people need to stop having cellphones in hand. It's going to cause suffering later.

Drivers should not be able to use a cellphone while driving because it leads to serious accidents. These accidents could lead to paralyzation or death. The fact that people still do this is scary. It's highly dangerous and risky to be doing this at all. Hopefully, in the future, they will create some type of equipment to detect people with phones in hand, because if they don't more drivers and their passengers may face death and destruction.",1
"Phones & Driving

Waking up from a wonderful dream, you look around to what you can describe as your dull or gloomy-like room. Without even realizing, you've already picked up your phone and start to browse your social media. You check the time and go look outside your window and it looks like a wonderful day. You quickly decide to blast your music and dress up fashionably before you go out to your friend's place. Alast you finish by taking many, many selfies and videos and then share them all to your friends and a few social media platforms while getting in the car. Now you've started the car and are now on the way to your friend's house as planned before. On your drive, text messages start to ring your phone a lot and people try calling you. Meanwhile you are on the highway. Mind you, you just started driving two weeks before, so you're practically new to this.

At this point you only have two options, are you willing to get on this phone while driving? Or should you wait until your vehicle is at rest? You want to convince yourself that it may be an emergency but is it really a smart decision to fiddle with that device while driving? Let alone on a highway at about 75 mph? Which leads to the topic of this essay, whether or not a driver should use their cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In general, cell phones are a huge distraction to society itself. Some in a good way, such as passing by time. But some in a dangerous way, such as operating a vehicle. Let's talk about how dangerous this is. According to research, reasons you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is pretty obvious. It's dangerous in numerous ways, as little as two second distraction is just enough to see who's calling and texting your cell phone but it's also just enough time to get you into a crash and cause chaos. Those few moments of looking at your phone rather than the road you're moving far and even enough to where you wouldn't see any pedestrians, motorcycles/bikes, or another person unexpectedly braking in front of you. Apparently stats show that cell phone use while operating a vehicle has increased with an added fact that 18 to 29 years olds are more than likely to be the people trying to access phones while driving. While that age group tends to have the high frequency of doing so, research supports that the age group over 65 have the lowest frequency. It wouldn't even be smart to use a phone at traffic lights. You may fail to go at the green light and that's when the illegal part comes in. There are tremendous amounts of consequences that can happen from driving all being, punishable or harmful.

In comparison, many other people may disagree and say that using a phone could be helpful. Based upon research, people claim there are great benefits to using your cell phone while driving. People feel they can use cell phones while driving safely with the help of hands-free technology. With laws banning hands-on behind the wheel impacting regions, drivers are saying that it's the typing of letters which takes too long that makes it dangerous. Even though people using hands-free devices and hands-on devices are equally bound to end up in a car accident, hands-free drivers tend to get fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than drivers using hands-on cell phones. More research states that pros of using a cellphone are for lifeline, navigation, cameras, traffic reports, and crime reporting. Drivers may need lifeline for road-side assistance for problems like car accidents where time is tight or paramedics and other emergency contacts that may be needed. Navigation assists drivers in locationing and maps providing real-time traffic reports, this supports the hands-free benefit of cell phones by a lot because it is very much needed. Cameras are important for quick situations such as car crashes. The person may need to hurry and catch a picture of the licence plate of whom might be performing a hit and run. Traffic reports provide drivers with up-to-date traffic updates on traffic jams, highway closings, and accidents. And lastly crime reporting for suspicious and illegal actions a driver may have spotted. With research it's clear many drivers can support that there are ways to operate vehicles while driving safely.

In my opinion, there shouldn't necessarily be any use of a cell phone while operating a vehicle. It's very dangerous and can cause people to be harmed badly and even bring death upon people. I feel that bluetooth music, texting, and calls, are not an excuse to grab the phone while driving. All texts and calls can wait because little do you know your life's on the line especially when your vehicle is moving at any type of speed. And music can be changed within good time management. I understand that people may have jobs that may require them to use their phones while driving and that's where advanced technology takes place. Advanced technology is allowing vehicles to assist drivers for safety or the vehicle may even drive itself. Hands-free cell phone usage has been promoted but now more safely than ever in this generation but I still feel that even all of the hands-free technology can even be quite an amount of distractions. Mind you one of the biggest and important rules of driving is to focus on the road. It may be hard sometimes considering that at young ages cell phones are practically habitual and it's almost like we need them for everything. Notice how in the introduction I brought how a cell phone is being used. That was to show how big of a role a cell phone plays in our lives, and me mentioning being a new driver was to have a bigger as to why the phone shouldn't be used. Using a cell phone while driving is very, very dangerous to you, and even others in some cases.

In conclusion, if causing harm and chaos is the last thing you want, the suggestion should be to not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Hands-free may sound great and all but it can be just as risky as hands-on cell phones. Surely the messages and calls being received can wait until after your drive. There is no need to add on top of stats like accidents because of cell phones. As the saying goes ""safety first!"" And that safety plays a big role in everything, in this case driving.

Now back to the questions. Are you willing to get on this phone while driving? Or should you wait until your vehicle is at rest? What's your decision?

"Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. You Should always want the best thing for you safety. Cell phones distracts the driver from the road. It could cause an accident and potentially kill you. Texting and driving is also illegal in almost every state.

Being on a cell phone while driving distracts you. You can lose focus on the road and swerve into a different lane and cause an accident. Being distracted can cause you to miss a turn you were supposed to make. A car in front of you can make a sudden stop and if you're on your phone you wouldn't have a quick reaction.

Being on a cell phone while driving could have you in a very bad accident and you could potentially die. Continuously looking down at the phone and the road is difficult. The roads are not a straight path and looking at the phone you wouldn't be able to realize that your driving a slight curve and you swerve into another lane, then you look up and see that your in two lanes you try to swerve back into your lane and a car was coming up on the side of you and now your in an accident.

Cops be on almost on every corner, and in undercover cars. If they see and realize you're on your phone they will pull you over and write you a pricey ticket. Some cops are petty and will put you in handcuffs. Others can be generous and let you off with a warning, but that doesn't make it okay to keep doing.

These reasons are why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phone behind the wheel. It increases the risk of an accident. It decreases the driver's awareness. It also distracts the drivers. It also worries the passengers because your putting their life in danger as well as yours",1
"Phone & Driving Required Essay

In this essay I will be talking about if people should be able to be on their cellular device while they drive or should they not be able to? In my opinion I don't think we should be able to because there are many dumb drivers without phones in their hands and the good drivers turn worse with one in their hands. More car crashes will happen and more deaths will come with it. I just don't think putting another distraction in drivers hands would be the best option for the road.

To start off this essay I believe having any type of electronic device while you are operating a vehicle is a distraction and can cause wrecks and deaths. No type of electronic device should be in the drivers hand only type that should be allowed is the phone holders that are legal that clip onto your A/C vents but shouldn't be texting on it only phone calls and the driver should always have both hands on the steering wheel as you drive.

To conclude my essay having a phone while driving is not necessary in any way. Just wait till you park somewhere or you get home to check it, because your life is more important than a text message.",1
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives.

People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc.

Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says ""[He] came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of ""[...] the rusty red Camaro [tailgating] the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody",1
"Should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving you may ask? I believe not. In this essay, I will be explaining why drivers should NOT use their devices while operating a vehicle.

Using a cellular device while driving is a dangerous hazard. An expanding number of studies demonstrate that driving while at the same time chatting on a cellphone can be very distracting. However, most states have not banished handheld telephones, and none have prohibited all drivers from utilizing without hand gadgets.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research mobile phones are driving components that reason mishaps. Studies demonstrate that a mobile phone put drivers at a four-time more serious danger of an accident. Regardless of risk, individuals still use mobile phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals.

People state that hands-free set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. I any case, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing an accident and even make it worse by recommending that the conduct is protected. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing a headset can be as hazardous as holding a telephone while driving while driving that the discussions can take away attention from the drivers from concentration on the road and other drivers.

In conclusion, if individuals don't give up the cellular devices the number of innocent people dying on the streets will increase. It is the individual's duty to not bring about their own and other individuals lives. We need to stop these reckless accidents over something that is so simple to do. Put your phones away until you reach a certain location.",1
"Do you feel like you are constantly racing around life? I am. I practically live somewhere between my car and high school. My days are spent racing from one place to another or from one activity to another. Good bad or indifferent, I am home to sleep and re-charge in the evenings and weekends. If I didn't have a cell phone to use in my car, you might not hear from me for days. My phone is currently my co-pilot in life.

Sad but probably true.

I am a supporter of cell phone usage while in the car.

The ability to use a cell phone is necessary in these times. It is a on the go kind of world. My teachers email me. I keep up with my grades. I get emails. I can check the weather. I can keep up with my friends. My phone serves as my personal trainer. I can check my bank account. In the event of an emergency, having a cell phone that can allow me to seek help, report problems and potentially save lives. The importance of a cell phone goes way beyond the option to make or receive phone calls.

According to Google, in 1973 the first cell phone was portable so it could travel with you. This is a game changer. I can keep up with family and friends with the capability to use my phone on the go. Guess what? They keep up with me too. We are so busy we don't even have a home phone. With the capabilities of a cell phone, we can run our lives from where ever we are.

My cell phone serves as my one stop shop. It is always having everything I need with me.

With the advances in technology we are now able to pair our phones with our cars either by aux or blue tooth. This is genius. We don't even have to worry about holding our phone. In addition, it is hands free and voice activated. I am a law-abiding citizen and I always sync my phone after I fasten my seat belt.

I type in my first location to my next to avoid traffic and crashes.

With safe phone usage, cell phones should be allowed in your car. My phone serves as my safety device and my directions. I can find gas stations easily or change my driving due to traffic. My mom can keep up with me, unless I turn off my location.

Just kidding, that's against rules at my house.",1
"Phones And Driving

We all know how it feels to be driving and receiving text from friends and or family. Its very hard to say no to yourself after you see the notification. A lot of people just tell themselves ""just real quick"" or ""just this one time"". Everyone knows that texting and driving is a bad idea but nobody knows exactly why. About 90 percent of car crashes are not due to drunk drivers or people who are speeding. But they are due to drivers like me and you who think they can do two things at once.

Answering these text messages takes a lot of attention off the road. As humans we can only multitask in a couple ways and they aren't that good. Texting and driving causes you lose awareness of what's around you. People crash most cause they don't see oncoming vehicles or they don't see certain things from a distance. Keeping your eyes off the road can be the difference between life or death in a car crash. It all comes down to how fast you were going and your reflexes.

driving doesn't feel dangerous. We may recognize on a cognitive level that distracted driving is stupid, but we have no accompanying visceral feeling of fear, no associated emotion to guide our decision-making in the moment of temptation. Our brains do such a good job making us feel like we're in charge that we don't realize it's all an illusion until it's too late. If our hearts started racing as soon as our attention started to drift, we might be more inclined to stay focused.

we feel immune to the risks that affect other people. Researchers who study texting while driving find that their participants ""have observed others driving erratically while using a cell phone, but these participants rarely, if ever, thought that their own driving was impaired when they used the cell phone."" And despite the fact that there is no benefit to practice (people who regularly use their cell phone while driving perform no better in studies than those with less real-life experience), the belief that we can manage persists. Consistent with this, three out of four people think they are above average drivers (a statistical impossibility). We are simply overconfident in our abilities.",1
"Phones & Driving

Do you use your phone while you're driving? Or do you be in the car with people who use their phone while they're driving? I believe we should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.

Emergencies always happen on the road. It ranges from wrecks to flat tires. People always need road side assistance. Without a phone how would you call 911 if someone have a wreck and need assistance right away? Things always happen when you're on the road, you can only control the way you drive. Not the way others drive.

Most people don't know there way round the whole entire world. It's not fun to be lost. So directions is the key to stay on track. We don't want to stop people on the road to keep asking them questions. You may say ""Why not just use a map""? Maps are confusing for some people. Not everyone is like that though some people rather go old fashion. Also some people might not have extra money to buy a car GPS. If you have an app on your phone for free, why pay money out your pocket?

Weather is important while you're driving. Some weather be to savior to drive in. So checking it frequently is important. Weather can cause accidents and everything. How else you're going to check it while traveling? The radio may tell you but what if you miss, what you are going to do then?

Seeing all should of changed your mind. If not changed your mind it made you rethink things. Just remember using phones while driving is okay. We should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.",1
"Phones & Driving

In today's day and age, we are privileged to have the ability to drive vehicles anywhere that we please. The use of technology gave us the responsibility of driving. With that being said the responsibility of driving is very important because you're not only putting your life at risk, but also other drivers on the road. There can be many distractions while you are driving which can cause you to wreck and be seriously injured from it. One of the biggest distractions in today's age is the use of cellphones. With the improvements made to technology, you can use cellphones anywhere on the road, which causes it to be the number one distraction. I personally feel that the use of technology should not be allowed while driving unless it is under an extreme circumstance.

To begin, one of the main reasons that causes cellphones to be one of the most distracting items is due to the texting and driving. According to the National Safety Council they reported that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". They also reported that ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving. Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use. Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do. It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day. With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens. I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations. There are many reoccurring issues with cellphones and driving that I'll be sharing more of in this essay.

After writing my first paragraph I ended off talking about the teens and cell phone use while driving situation. As the majority of people know the using your phone is very dangerous and also distracting. However, with the teen's situations there are 16-year old's and older who are not that experienced with driving but are also more easily distracted then adults. There was a poll made by AAA saying that ""94 percent of teen drivers know the dangers of using their phone while driving and up to 34 percent admitted to doing it anyway"". With this kind of statistic just proves the point of not allowing any use of a phone in a motor vehicle. I would also like to talk about the other drivers on the road. There are many other safe and focused drivers on the road, who are following all the rules of the road. Those careful drivers have also been the victims and ended up being seriously injured from the distracted driving with phones and also many other reasons. I personally have an example to give with this problem. My Cousin was killed by a driver who was going down a road, speeding in the rain, and also texting while driving on top of all that. Phones being used in motorized vehicles is a serious issue and luckily a law has passed in the state of Georgia, stopping the use of them in cars, but hopefully people will start to follow that law.

There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has.

"The use of cellphones while driving should not be allowed at all. People put themselves and others at risk, safety should always go first. Throughout the years cell phone use has increased a lot. People use cell phones daily, sometimes when walking you don't notice where you're going and bump into someone. That's something minor but let's say you're driving while using you're device that's major, a car accident may be caused.

I believe cell phones should not be used while driving because it's a big distraction. Car wrecks would be avoided, which decreases the amounts of deaths. Also the person that was distracted is most likely the one to put at fault this may lead to lawsuits. Even if texting while driving were to be legal that does not mean it is safe. We should avoid all types of distractions while driving.

Another reason is because if you are caught using you're phone while driving by a cop or because of an accident. You're car insurance will be affected, if you were already paying a lot it's most likely that the payment will now be doubled. That could be easily avoided, another reason is that you shouldn't put at risk your passengers. It is better be safe than sorry.

There is a lot of reasons this should not be allowed. Safety should be taken serious. Car accidents, lawsuits, being hospitalized is not a joke, people die due to others being distracted when they're on their phones while driving. We should avoid any type of distraction while driving to avoid bad consequences.",1
"I believe that drivers should not use their phones while driving. The reason behind this is that Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. In some cases restrictions are directed at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones.

In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2017, 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash.

Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done.

In conclusion, I believe that driving while using your mobile device should not be allowed. It is a distraction that can cause the driver and innocent bystanders to lose their lives over something that can easily be prevented.

"Phones and driving

This essay is about if drivers should or not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road.

Using your cellphone can actually be deadly. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective.

Using your cell phone while driving is very common nowadays. When people use their cell phones while driving it sometimes has a negative effect. Cell phone usage while driving is a common occurrence in today's society. Unfortunately, it often has a negative impact on drivers using phones and those surrounding them. Because of the growing popularity of cellular devices in modern society, the urge for the public to use their phones frequently is severe.

When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second. Many deadly accidents are caused by someone bending down to simply pick up their phone that fell on the floor of the car. Many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens. That's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours.",1
"The use of cellular phones has spread substantially the last ten years. It has become a part of everyday life for many Americans. Unfortunately, the use of cellphones for everyday life a lot of the times, takes place in cars. As a result, many accidents have taken place due to the use of cellular phones while on the road. Many people are not aware of just how serious this has become, which is why people should not be allowed to use phones in cars without a hands free device.

The use of phones while driving not only puts the person driving in danger, but all the people around them. It takes one person to make one decision that can affect the lives of many.

People do not take into consideration the horrible facts about accidents caused by cell phones when choosing to use their phones. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. It also states that nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving and 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk, but people still to this day do not think about the possible consequences of phones and driving.

Phones are not always a bad thing in cars, when following the right protocols. They help with navigation, communication, and are vital in the event of an emergency. Many states have banned the use of using a cell phone in any manner without a hands free device, which has decreased the amount of phone caused accidents. This law, although a struggle for some to follow, ultimately has everyone's best interest. People everywhere should be educated about the dangers of cell phone use in cars and about safer alternatives, and should be punished for not using a safer solution.

As seen, driving while talking on the phone is very dangerous. Also, with new laws if you're caught, you can be fined and could ultimately get your driver's license suspended. People can avoid all this trouble by only talking on your mobile phone when you are parked and out of the way of traffic. It could save your life one day. The use of a hands-free kit with your mobile phone as you drive doesn't eliminate risk, as you still might be distracted, but it does help cut it down. Driving a car is dangerous enough without adding still more risk by texting or talking and it is important that people are aware of that",1
"Texting/Drive

Should you text and drive, no you shouldn't. Texting and driving is a bad thing it can cause accidents and people might die including yourself. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. Of these, 1.6 million have a cell phone involved in them. That's the majority of all road accidents in the United States. Over half the road accidents in the States have cell phones involved, and if this doesn't make you realize just how potent it is, what will. Texting and driving should not be allowed because a lot of innocent people each year die because someone wants to be on there phone.

In most states, texting while driving is considered a primary-enforcement violation, which means officers can issue citations any time they observe drivers texting and driving. Others have secondary enforcement, meaning officers can issue citations only if they've stopped drivers for some other offense. People can be charged for texting and driving such as Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. You also have Criminal charges, in some states texting while driving can result in criminal misdemeanor charges Class B or C. Class B misdemeanors are punished between 90-180 days in county jail. Class C misdemeanors receive the least amount of time, usually 30 days or less.

Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. There are more accidents in texting and driving than all the road accidents in the U.S. each year, that's a major problem.

I believe the penalty should stay the same time in jail and the fines that you'll receive. Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Time in jail, between 90-180 days in county jail. But the major part of it is if you kill another individual person in the process, which I think you should be given major charges. Fines should be over $500 up to the $10,000 range. And time in jail should be 20 years maybe more depending on how many people you killed.

The conclusion to this is that Texting and driving is a major problem and we need to find ways to stop it. It's only going to get worse, because of the new technology that will be coming in the future. Even though people have habits for checking their phone they should just turn it off and focus on the road. That in all should stop the accidents in a hole, but sometimes people have import things they need to do I understand, but try to find ways to stop. You might be even saving your own life.

Have you been in a car and the driver decides to take a call while driving. You may not have gotten into an accident but for a limited time your life is completely in danger. Situations like this is why i think drivers should not use technology while operating a vehicle. Using technology while operating a vehicle because it can result in a distraction, causes of accidents, and putting others at risk.

There are a few people that would say they have to turn their music down to figure out exactly where their going. This is a type of distraction which is not good for the road. Distractions makes you lose focus of your surroundings while your driving. Resources shows that you are 25% more likely to look at your phone on the road if it rings. In 2015 391,00 injuries were caused by distracted driver. Distracted drivers are considered a new epidemic in america. With different technology being developed there are easier ways of people to get distracted while driving.

Using technology does a lot to a person while driving. Someone can gets into a really bad car accident because they are trying to answer a phone call or send a text. There are 1.6 million crashes on an annual bases. 19 people are killed daily by drivers who are texting.6-16% of all deaths in the us are caused by drivers sending or reading text messages. These deaths could easily be avoided if people don't look at or answer their phones while driving. Using technology doesn't just put yourself in danger but it puts others in danger as well. It endangers everyone around you. When you drive your life and people your in the car with live are in your hands and you shouldn't take that for granted. You have to be mindful on what you do to make sure everyone is ok.

In conclusion drivers should not use technology while driving because it puts everyone around them at risk. When drivers are on the road their focus should be on the road. They should not have distractions because those distractions can end someone's life in a blink of an eye. The text or call is not more important than you and the people around you lives.",1

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over the past two decades phones and technology have expanded and so have the dangers of getting behind the wheel with a cellular device. I believe that no one has a reason to be doing anything other than driving when in a vehicle. Cellular devices have become a major issue whether you're a senior citizen or a beginner at driving.

Over the past few years that technology has expanded into many forms more and more casualties have occurred on the roads. The United States Department of Transportation reported that cell phones are involved in about 1.6 million auto crashes each year meaning that these 1.6 million car crashes involved cellular devices being a distraction to drivers. Some of the cell phone related car crashes lead to deaths of the distracted drivers and even the people who weren't even behind the wheel. There are many different ways to be distracted by a cellular device. This includes texting, maps, email, and social media.

Emotions over text messages could also effect a driver's state of mind while driving. If a driver were to get mad or upset over something they saw or read they could get distracted and lose control of the vehicle. Also could affect others that are driving. Other drivers could be in danger if someone can't see because they are distracted texting someone back. Overall this means that emotions could overcome someone if they used a cellular device while driving.

The law in Georgia is called the hands free law in my own words I think of this as both hands on the wheel. This is the way that drivers should drive all the time with both hands on the wheel. Using one hand to call someone could cause you to not be able to react in an emergency. If an animal jumped in front of a car of someone using a hand to see the map on their phone for directions it could lead them to crashing and harming the animal because of the panic and only one hand to steer. I think that both hands is an important safety when it comes to driving.

These three major points support my reason as to why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices behind the wheel. Emotion effecting the capability of someone driving, casualties because of distractions caused by cellular devices and, two free hands that will make the possibilities of crashing slim to none.",1
"Phones & Driving

In today's day and age, cellphones are extremely portable and accessible. Cellphones now seem to alway be in our hands and there've been debates on when we can and can't use them. Cellphones are always there even during crucial times and the wrong times. Texting and driving is an extremely dangerous act that causes major distractions, puts your life as well as others in danger.

Since the creation of the cellphone in 1973, phones have caused distractions. The creation of text in 1992 enhanced the distractions the cellphones caused and ever since then the distractions have gotten bigger. Those distractions while doing an activity that demands so much attention such as driving can be extremely dangerous, especially texting while driving. Texting while driving makes up 1 out of 4 car accidents, leads to 1.6 million crashes a year, and causes about 400,000 injuries each year.

Car accidents not only injure those who text and drive but it also leads to second hand effects of it. Thousands of injuries and deaths happen yearly due to distracted drivers harming others and those people could be passengers or just pedestrians. The danger for those who aren't the distracted driver are usually higher, since the passengers in the back don't have airbags and random pedestrians have no protection against the driver. Drivers shouldn't just take themselves into consideration, but also the safety of others around them.

The characteristics of distracted driving have been compared to their types of impairment driving. Driving such as drunk driving have been compared to distracted driving and drunk driving has even been proven to be less dangerous in some ways than distracted driving. Distracted driving had well over 100,000 more injuries than drunk driving, but drunk driving has well over 6,000 more deaths attributed towards it. The age group for distracted driving is mainly shifted towards teenagers and young adults between 18-24, rather that of the 26-29 range of drunk driving. It's been suggested that at any given point there'll be over 660,000 drivers using their phones while behind the wheel of a vehicle. States that ban cellphones at the wheel have resulted in the increase of hands free use as impaired to the states who haven't.

These numbers in accidents and deaths tend to go up or stagger any given year, the numbers won't go down if no ban on cellphones at wheel is placed. Teenagers are the most affected by any distractions caused by a cellphone, making them most likely to get in an accident. Distracted driving has resulted in more accidents than drunk driving and a plentiful number of unfortunate deaths. No driver, in any capacity should be allowed to drive while texting or distracted in any matter by a cellphone. It should be illegal and carrying the same punishments as a DUI would considering the number of accidents caused by such driving.

Cell phones are essential tools in society that humans use to perform day-to-day operations such as communicating with others, checking the weather, and researching random topics on the Internet, however there is a time and a place for everything and cell phones should not be used by drivers in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle. Cell phones are helpful in many different forms, however they also distract you from what is in front of you. To use a cell phone you need to look at it which diverts your attention from what is physically happening around you. It is dangerous to not pay attention to what is happening around you when you were driving because it puts you and others at risk for danger. If a driver is not allowed to use their phone while operating a vehicle, then you eliminate the possibility of a car accident caused by the distraction of a cellular device.

Cons of a having a cell phone in a car

When driving, you need to pay attention to the road in order to get from your starting destination to your final destination safely. You can put yourself in harm's way when you are not paying attention to what you are doing. When using a cell phone in a car you are worried about what is happening on your phone and not worrying about what is happening in the world. You then have to switch back-and-forth really quickly to know what is going on in the road and what is happening on your phone. You can cause a major car accident which can result in the loss of life and you will become a murderer by law if you were distracted while driving. Drivers who cause accidents due to them being distracted by their cellular devices, are liable to those who were negatively affected in the accident and can be fine for using their cell phones in many different state. This reinforces the dangers that using a cell phone while driving hats.

Laws for distracted driving. In order to prevent car accidents, Government officials have put laws in place to lower the use of cellular devices while driving. Government officials have concluded that many distractions do exist while driving however cellular devices are one of the major distractions that cause the most accidents across many different states. Officials have tried to come back to this distraction by making cards with hands-free technology built into the dashboards and states have made laws prohibiting cell phone use while driving. To lower car accident rates Even further, employers put pants on the use of both hands free devices and cellular devices. Ever since state and employees have placed restrictions on cell phone use while driving, statistic show that car accidents have been on a decrease every single year.

The confident driver. A lot of drivers will argue that since they have been driving for X amount of time or because they perform so well on their drivers test, then they should be able to use their cell phones because they do not believe that they will cause any accidents. The science says differently. Science says there are many distractions on the road well a person is driving. People cause these accidents have been driving for various different amounts of years. Some of these drivers have been driving for 10+ years and others a few months. Win drivers who are using their phones at the time of the accident report there side of the story they always say that they did not see the other persons in some way, shape, form, or fashion. That is because the average reaction time of a distracted driver is 1.5 seconds. Accident reconstruction specialist also found that the average driver reaction Breaktime was to be 2.3 seconds. And with most driving accidents, a person has between about 0.7 to three seconds to react in avoid crashing. This reaction time of a human being is greatly slow with the distraction of a cell phone which leads virtually no time for the distracted driver to correct themselves.

Driving with phones

Driving with the phone is very dangerous to do. Cellular devices can and will cause drivers to divert their attention from the things surrounding them. Studies show that using cellular devices while driving increases the amount of car accidents. Using a cell phone while driving will slow down your reaction time when you are put in danger while on the road. In many different states, using your phone while driving is illegal. This is why drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

"Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation.

This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. In conclusion cellphones are not safe to use while driving",1

Texting and driving isn't for anyone it's one of the fastest ways to end your life over one of the smallest things and we don't want that to happen. These are a few reasons texting and driving will ruin your life, drivers lose all awareness on the road and not paying attention, they lead to more crashes, and you're most likely to be at fault during an accident.

"TEXTING AND DRIVING ESSAY

Today, a lot of car accidents are caused by distracted driving. Texting while driving caused a lot of deaths and injuries Over the last few years. People confused themselves when it comes to texting and driving and they don't realize it's a mistake until it's too late. In my opinion I think its best if people turn their phones of completely before they leave their location. Texting and driving is against the law so young drivers and older adults should take it serious.

It doesn't matter who's texting you that notification can wait. Taking your eyes off the road while driving should never be acceptable. Me personally, I don't think it's the smartest decision to pick up my phone while driving for any reason. Another reason why it's not safe to text and drive is because it's against the law. Breaking the law against texting and driving results in you having to pay money out your pockets. So just try your best to avoid the situation.

"Should Drivers Use Cellphones While Driving?

Cell Phones have become a prominent part of most peoples lives in this contemporary era. Smartphone ownership is growing rapidly around the world. In addition, the worlds population is 7.6 billion with an estimated 1.4 billion cars on the road. That is a vast eighteen percent of the population. This leads to the question, should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I feel as though you should not touch your phone while operating a vehicle. A person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while texting and driving.

It maybe argued that people need their phones in dire emergencies. This is where the campaign ""It can wait"" comes in and other programs to promote wireless usage (ex. Bluetooth). Thus, ceasing any hands-on phone activity while operating the vehicle. Bluetooth wireless makes things more convenient for vehicle users. Calls, music listening, and more can be accessed using Bluetooth.

When texting and driving, your focus is mostly on your phone. Your focus is supposed to be fully on the road. Not only is there traffic, but you also must look out for pedestrians. You must be aware so that you can be able to react quickly to pedestrians that aren't aware and potential accidents (due to poor judgement of other drivers). Knowing and keeping track of your speed and the speed limit is also crucial. You cannot do as listed above when fully submerged in your phone.

Additionally, laws are being passed to stop driving and using a cellphone in any capacity of a vehicle. If seen doing so, you will get a ticket. As of July 1st, 2019, this law was put in place in Georgia. You would also receive a moving violation. Moving violations affect auto insurance. While cellphones are very convenient, we must be able to articulate when and where to use them.

We are aware of places where they are prohibited (e. g.: court rooms, airplanes, movies) therefore it will take some getting used to not being on your phone at all while driving. It is not impossible, though. We can still receive phone calls, especially those very important ones, of course. As mentioned before, the Bluetooth may be hooked up to your car, therefore one may talk wirelessly whilst driving. The conversation may be heard via speakers in the car. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It can always wait.

"Phones and Driving

Today many people have cellular devices and they can be a constant problem. Some people have a habit where they look at there phone way to often, this is a problem. If someone is to be driving and they constantly look at their phones their risking their lives or maybe the lives riding in the vehicle. It is very dangerous and raises the risk of car accidents you could have. It is also illegal to text in drive because it's a safety hazard for drivers.

Phones affect society the more they develop and we will continue to buy cellular products. We buy these to stay in touch with friends, family, and the work place or maybe you might have one for research or games. The problem with these devices are that people tend to text and drive. Texting while driving is a risky action to take while operating a vehicle. Phones are a distraction to people who drive and can't leave the phone alone. This distraction is serious it can get someone severely injured, killed or even a ticket.

There is a law for texting and driving that's good because it can prevent more people to stop texting and driving. The law bans cellular use while operating a vehicle so that we can prevent car crashes. This law is important without this law there wouldn't be no control on texting and driving. Most people follow the law but many more people don't. There are also certain age groups who text and drive and there are affects from the age groups.

Different age groups tend to text and drive. Teens are more distracted by the devices because teens usually text friends a lot and it becomes a habit. Teens who drive are still learning to drive better and when phones distract them it raises their chance higher than other age groups because their reaction time may not be high as developed drivers. Adults with higher driving skills who text and drive still have a high risk of a car crash. They have better driving experience but it's still possible that they could crash. Crashing is a cause by not paying attention or the other person could be the one that was distracted.

Texting and driving is as dangerous as drinking and driving. Texting and driving raises the chance of crashing six times higher than drinking and driving. Each year at least 1.6 million drivers have crashed because of being distracted at least six thousand drivers have been killed by being distracted. Drunk driving causes more than ten thousand lives per year. It doesn't matter which one is more dangerous it's still a high risk for a car accident.

Texting and driving should not be allowed because this can get people injured or killed. To prevent texting and driving there should be more officers on the road stopping people from texting and driving this should be affective in areas where texting and driving is high. The reason I said areas where texting and driving is high is because if a lot of people text and drive in the same area not everyone is paying attention and this could cause more crashes. This will also make people know they shouldn't text and drive because the police are out to give tickets. Hopefully this idea will work permanently without having police around trying to give out tickets.

It's good that police give tickets to those who do text and drive, they don't do it because their picking on you they do it to help prevent you from risking your life. When a officer gives you a ticket this ticket usually comes with a fine. You have to pay this fine or there will be serious consequences. You driver license may be suspended and you won't be able to drive any where. This is bad for people who work, go to school or go places they need to be. Hopefully people will learn it's not right because it's not worth risking your life over a text you could have waited to send.",1
"Cell phones are an inescapable part of modern life, providing information and connection that has become an expected part of everyone's routine. However, this becomes complicated the moment your phone and car meet. On one hand, the GPS is an essential tool for any road trip, on the other, distracted driving is dangerous, and sometimes fatal. A balance needs to be struck, one where you can drive without distractions, and still get where you need to go.

For many people, the use of their phone is non-negotiable. Either for location, or for podcasts and music that break the monotony of a daily commute. At the same time using one's phone has a notable impact on one's performance driving. In many states, the solution proposed is to make it illegal to touch one's phone while driving. This allows a GPS to give directions, or for a person to dictate calls or voice commands while reducing the amount of time spent looking away from the road.

With hands free driving, someone can still interact with their cellular device, give commands, find directions, and communicate with others while still looking at the road. With smartphones offering voice assistants, it's no longer necessary for people to directly interface with their phones, meaning people are no longer spending as much time looking down at their phones and away from the road.

If people were no longer allowed to use their phones on the road, while crashes may decrease, people would be cut off from a world where doing so is becoming increasingly detrimental. It would be foolish to walk away from such increasing connectivity for an extreme solution such as banning cellphones in cars. Such a ban would be an overly drastic solution to a more nuanced problem, leaving people greatly inconvenienced for the sake of a heavy handed solution.

If a proper balance is able to be found between reducing the distractions phones provide to drivers and maximizing the amount of benefit still available to them, it would be greatly preferable to an all out ban on the devices in cars, and would reduce road fatalities and crashes while still maintaining the accessibility and convenience smartphones provide on a daily basis. So no, phones should not be banned on roads, but they should not be unregulated either, as with many issues, it is not black and white, and to approach it as such would be to ignore the vastly superior solutions hiding in the swatches of grey between the two extremes.",1
"Phones and Driving

Is it hard for you to put your phone down while driving? Hopefully it isn't because there are so many things that could be prevented.

Most of the time, people who text and drive think they can do both things at once.

Previous studies have shown,""In the United States,3328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone..."". This shows that it's become very common which is absolutely wrong,your keeping you eyes off the road each time you glance over at your phone. As we know, anything could happen during that time you kept your eyes off for a few seconds.

Also a main reason why you shouldn't operate both things at once, is simply because it's illegal in some states. You don't want to be paying a fine much less do jail time. It's definitely not worth you being on your phone. And most definitely not worth your life or the life of others. For example,""A Minnesota woman sent and received 240 texts while driving one morning, before hitting and killing a motorcyclist on a highway exit ramp. she was acquitted of felony criminal vehicular homicide and instead convicted of careless driving,which carries a penalty of a month in jail and $50,000 in restitution"". It's very common for officers to check how long ago you were on your phone before the accident to see if that was what lead to it.

These accidents could be easily avoided, considering the fact that companies have built bluetooth in cars so that if you get a call you can pick up through the car. Or as plain and simple as it sounds just don't pick up the phone at all.

Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people. Drivers need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices

These advertisements are hard to watch. No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel

It can be dangerous to text and drive and in the united stated have around one out ten people are killed other people off the earth from text and driving Because it's an issue of attention-and there is only minimal extra distraction when picking up or holding a phone-it doesn't really help to use a hands-free device. Merely thinking about something other than the road is enough to strain attention and increase your risk of a crash.

You should not text on your cell phone while driving because being distracted by texting is similar to driving while intoxicated. Texting on the phone while driving can cause you to react more slowly when an unexpected driving hazard emerges or perhaps to never see the hazard until it's too late for the other people in the car to not to get hunt other on the road the haved a red light to having crash car and to texting and drive.

"The Dangers of Your Cell Phone on Roads

Communication is something that has been given to the human race ever since the first man was coined and has been ever so crucial for our development to how we are today. We come so far as to create a device to communicate at great distances with a single tap, this device is known as a cell phone. The device has gone through many alterations time after time to satisfy the needs of the average user. Cell phones are used on a daily basis and most spend up to nine hours a day, this behavior can be described as addicting. This addiction causes many people to not be aware of their surroundings which leads to many accidents; most of accidents occur on the road. Drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones when in use of a motorized vehicle because it increases the chance for an accident and decreases focus during the ride.

Cell phones require much focus in order for one to operate it correctly, the same goes for using a vehicle so when you come across someone that is using a cellphone and a car at the same time, the chances of hitting something massively increases by almost 900 percent. The obvious reason why so many end up in an accident is because if you're in a car traveling at 60 mph then that would suggest that for every second you don't see the road you miss about sixteen meters of distance, sixteen meters is enough distance for anyone to be involved in an accident. Safety councils report that anyone operating a cellular device while driving leads to approximate 1.6 million crashes per year. Most of the crashes are generated by younger adults who are just beginning to explore the world but end abruptly caused by the foolish act of using a cell phone while driving. Some states are now combating this problem by being stricter on what is allowed in during the ride and may lead to a chain reaction for all state's decisions.

Government has had enough of all vehicle users to put innocent live at risk so they have passed bans for drivers so they would be punished if they are caught using a cell phone. About sixteen states have banned all drivers to have a cell phone in hand while in use of a vehicle including the District of Columbia, Guam, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. In Georgia, the law has been effective since the first of July last year (2018) and with the ban in place, less drivers are causing accidents because of the incentive to pay 50 dollars on their first conviction. This is a very good method for reducing the amount of people getting into crashes, it gives the tempting drivers to stop using their cell phone while driving. There are many more reasons why you should not use a cell phone during a use of a vehicle but these are two that could be major in rank.

Many people use the skill that was given to us since birth and communicate with others around the world, it is very useful and can grow your social life as well as your culture. Many take advantage of this and use their cell phones while driving and putting many lives at risk including theirs, hopefully this helps other in grasping the seriousness of doing such action and will rethink how they drive. When someone calls you while you're driving please be smart and don't use your cell phone, this is why you shouldn't use your cellphone during the use of a vehicle.",1

Should people be able to use their phones in any capacity while driving? They should. Should people have complete access to their phones while driving? No, some of the features on phones should not be accessible while driving. Is there danger with using a phone while driving? Yes, there is, but the danger is in most of what is done on a regular day basis.

Why should people have accessibility to phones while driving? People should be able to because it is their property. Someone can not deny someone the usage of something they bought with their own money. A salesman can't sell someone a fork and plate and tell them not to eat. The salesmen can tell the consumer the ups and downs of their product. Then it becomes that person´s choice or whether or not they want to take that risk. It is all about personal limits.

Stating that danger shouldn't be prevented is idiotic. But someone's argument against something should not be the dangers of it. Everything, including phones and driving, are dangerous in themselves, but the more they are done, the worst they get. With this being known, would someone try to prevent people from drinking water because some people have died from doing so. No, they would allow them the knowledge of the dangers and allow them to set their limits. The exact same thing should be done for phones while driving.

This essay keeps stating that to limit the person's usage. Nothing can be entirely prevented because people will do as they please. But if you set limits, more people are subjectable to follow such limits. They are even more willing to do so knowing the dangers or consequences of their actions. Finally, let people govern themselves. It is not one person´s nor is it a group of people´s choice on whether someone can or cannot do something.",1

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.

So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.",1
"People who drive vehicles should not be able to use their cell phones while driving. It can cause bad effects like a car crash or probably even more than what you can realize. It can be very dangerous. Did you know it can be more dangerous than drinking and driving?

Using a cell phone while driving can be harmful because you are not looking on the road and you are looking at your phone so you do not know what is going on around you. Also you can cause somebody else life that is doing the right thing while you are doing the wrong thing on the road. For an example you can be behind somebody and what if they press the breaks hard or stop and you do not know you just think they kept going ad you are on your phone and then boom car accident and it's going to be your fault because you were on your phone not paying attention to the road and then you have to pay for somebody else car damage and yours so the outcome would not look good for you either way. Another thing is you can get pulled over by a police and lose your license.

Another reason you should not text and drive is because you can end up seriously injured or probably killed. For an example in 2010 30,296 are deadly killed and 2,239,000 injured people that has been in a crash because of using their cell phones. People do not realize it can happen to them until they do it because people think it's not but when it does they can say nothing or if they are injured they are going to tell their friends and family do not do it and stuff like that and how it's not safe because they realize it's not nothing to be joking around with. Another reason driving and texting is not safe is you can get a ticket by the police officer. Also your car insurance will be more than what you are probably paying now and it might be hard for you to obtain it and stuff like that if you got other stuff you have to pay for.

Unless you want to end up in a wheelchair or in the hospital do not text and drive wait until you get in a rest area or pull over to the side if it is that important. Therefore, do not text and drive or there will be consequences.",1
"Should people be able to use their cell phones while driving?

Studies have shown that cell phone usage while operating a vehicle causes more car accidents than hands free driving.

It has been proven that driving without the use of your cell phone is 100% safer than driving while using your cell phone. Humans should not operate cell phones while driving, cell phone usage while driving is unsafe, People who use cell phones while driving put their lives in serious danger.

Humans should not operate cell phones while driving. People use their phones on a daily basis while driving yet, they pay little attention to the road while doing so. This can possibly cause accidents to happen. Many people have lost their life due texting and driving and just being on their phones. When driving its best to do it safely for the sake of your own like and others. Using your phone while driving dramatically increases your chances of crashing.

Cell phone usage while driving is unsafe. #1 reason why it is unsafe is because you can lose your life. Just reaching for things while driving takes your main focus off of the road and put you in danger. When your distracted from the road anything can happen even if its just a second thats all it takes for everything to go bad. For instance the second you look down at your phone for that text message is the same secon a pedestrian can walk across the street or another vehicle can cross your path and just like that your life can be ruined or it can be over.

People who use their phones while driving put their lives in serious danger. Recent studies have shown that the victims on texting and driving accidents are young drivers and the elderly. Kids are too attached to their phones and having a car at a young age today is an immediate risk one text message and they instantly have to read the message and at that moment it could be over. Cell phones should be put away while driving or on a phone holder just to keep things safe. All attention should be on the road and if needed a person can easily pull over and make a call.

Just put down the phone that one message or missed call can wait its not worth your life. People should stay safe and just be patient and pay attention to the road and others.",1

Technology has made a big impact on the world today. The number problem with technology is CELL PHONES! We use cell phones all day and night. There have been so many accidents and mostly the cost of texting and driving. I think that drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving but only if emergency & navigation. This will lead to lower accidents in the u. s.

We all want to be on are phones every minute and every second but here are some facts that will make you think twice before picking up the phone. Approximately 600,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile. There are nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents while texting and driving. The reason its it so high because people are convinced that texting and driving isn't dangerous, we need us humans to realize that lives matter so we need to reflect on risks.

On the day of July 1, 2018 a new law saying that "" Drivers cannot have a phone in their HAND or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving"". Meaning you will get a ticket and i'm pretty sure that nobody wants to get a 150-250 dollar ticket for doing something stupid. It's really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they're not on the phone.

People often feel like they will miss something and separated from the world when they aren't on their phone. So many many lives have been taken just because a single text or a single call. Thousands are dying and being injured. So no cell phones shouldn't be able to be used while driving.",1

During the past few years, phones become very popular in the world. Every generation has a telephone. A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. Phones are taking over the world, and a lot of people are getting addicted to their phones. Knowing that it is dangerous to text and drive, we still do it; 90 % of you agreed to have texted while driving. I'd be lying if I said I had never texted while driving. But I recognize the dangers, and use the alternatives to prevent a car accident. It doesn't matter what commercials we seen, or what car accident we have witness, we still text and drive and it's a fact.

In this generation, texting and driving have been the leading cause of car accidents, especially for teenagers. A lot of teenagers are losing their life cause of texting and driving. Most people think texting and driving are underrated. Some teenagers think that other teenagers that have an accident while texting and driving just don't know how to drive well. So they do it because they think that they can prevent it from happening to them because they can have control of it. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it can help many people to understand what would happen and hopefully teach them a lesson of the consequence when you text and drive. People really need to know and understand how easily it is to take theirs and someone else's life. Texting and driving is a serious hazard, which could ultimately cost you your life or others. This pressing issue needs well thought out ads that will convince people to act on this deadly habit and not just be aware of it.

And most of the time in many cases like this be happening to the age group of 18-25.

Not only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself, many people compare the danger level to drunk driving. Driving while intoxicated at the same time is illegal, just as some believe texting while driving should be as well. Drunk driving is another top cause of car accidents that happen every day. If people were more aware of how closely related texting while driving and drunk driving are, it would help to inform all drivers on safety behind the wheel. All of these hazards on the road are making other drivers very nervous. Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.

It is obvious that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but the majority of drivers continue doing so. Even with all the stories of disastrous car accidents transpiring as a direct outcome of distracted driving, teens and adults are still texting at the wheel. Overall I think a phone shouldn't be allowed in cars while driving. People should put their phones away like in their purse or somewhere it can't cause a distraction to them, because I know for fact that as soon as that phone ring or a notification comes on most people would reach for that phone, and it's at that moment their focus on the driving is lost. If people follow that rule, I think the rate of a car accident would decrease, and people would be alive and well. Today, texting while driving out numbers the amount of drunk driving according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Texting while driving is ten times more likely to cause a big accident than drunk driving. You are 23 times more likely to have an accident if you are texting.

A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. For this reason, many states are making new laws designed to curb such risky habits amongst drivers and enhancing safety on the road for others. In conclusion, texting while driving is a big issue, we are doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others people. Leave the phone alone or at home while you are driving because a text is not worth your life and somebody else's, that text will be there when you done driving or when you get home.",1

Cell phone usage while driving is one of the most causes of accidents to young teen drivers. In the United States,motor vehicle accidents due to distracted driving is increasing. While most people are aware of the risk of using a cell phone while driving, they still continue to take the risk anyway.. Texting while driving causes a 40 percent increase in accidents because of the time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.

Driving is not something to play around with especially for young drivers. It's responsibility to them and putting trust from their parents/guardian to not be in any big accidents. Because of how much death that have been occurred from the cell phones, they have legally made a law about the use of cellphones. Since then the toll numbers of death especially to young drivers have been dropped. Even though the bars have been drop we still got those kind of people who don't care about the law and still take risk their own lives with texting or being on the web while driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. As each year go by I can see that the government are doing their best to reduce the death toll of car crashes but one more title they soon gotta check up on is the deaths from drunk driving because they are the 2nd most cause of deaths in car crash just from drinking and driving.

Therefore, I believe that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Just recently in 2018 Georgia has just made a law called the ""Hands-Free-Law"". Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rule even tapping ""play"" on a Spotify playlist while not parked, face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second offense. Everything I have discuss result to me disagreeing to having phones while driving.",1

Cell phone use while driving has become the largest cause of automobile crashes over the last two decades. Using a phone while driving can cause distracted driving and even worse car accidents with fatalities. With drivers being distracted, it decreases their awareness on the road and leads to more car crashes. According to the United States Department of Transportation, in 2017, distracted driving claimed 3,166 lives in that year alone. Mobile phone use while driving distracts drivers in two ways; physically and cognitive distraction. Although many laws have been set in place in order for cell phone usage while driving to be banned, many ignore the law and still use cell phones. With this information being concluded, many feel as if drivers should not be able to use cellular phones while driving in any capacity.

There are many benefits from decreasing the number of drivers who choose to use their cell phone while driving.

In different states there are different cell phone law variations, but all do the same, they intend to prevent drivers from driving distractedly. Although, these laws are set in place, many do not adhere to and follow these laws. Furthermore, no state has banned the use of cell phones while driving, just adamant enforcement and strict restrictions. For example, fifteen states enforce the handheld cell-phone use law, which prohibits all drivers from using hand-held devices or cell-phones while driving. In addition to laws being put in place, if caught being on a cell-phone while driving, there are fines put in place.

On the other hand, there are many precautions that should be followed to prevent the use of cell phones while driving. Firstly, keeping your cell phone out of arm's length reach it should prevent the use of it. Secondly, if in a situation where a text message must be sent out, do it before driving and let whoever is being texted that you will be unreachable for a certain amount of minutes. Also, silencing a cell phone could be the difference in a life or death situation. Lastly, simply just keeping your focus on the road and not anything else could save a life.

Although cell-phones have detrimental effects on driving, they also have helpful factors as well. Many cell-phones have GPS systems that many people use while driving. Also, rideshare companies use cell-phones as a way to find riders and the drivers even use their cell-phones for GPS reasons. Furthermore, cell phones allow their users to make calls in the case of an emergency. For example, in the case of a serious car accident, where time is of the essence, cell phones are there for paramedics to be contacted immediately. Lastly, being able to use your cell phone while driving, permits you to be able to call authorities if they witness suspicious activity they have seen while driving.

Finally, using your cell-phone while driving has its' pros and cons. More importantly, its' cons. Cell phone related car accidents and fatalities continue to increase despite the legal legislative action by the states' government that prohibit specific cell phone related activities while driving. Regardless of the educational attempts about the risk of distracted driving and cell phone use to warn the general public, many refuse to abide by the law. In conclusion, drivers, in any capacity should not be able to use their cell phones while driving.",1

They trust you not to go off the road or into another car just because you looked down at your phone.

The number one reason why I think you should not because I know family member who died and was in a wreck because of them looking at their phone.

A phone is just a distraction. When driving just put the phone away till you're not driving anymore. Just like the tv commercial always says, ""A text can wait"", but your like can't if you die by texting while driving. Driving is a serious manner and it takes all you focus not to mess up. Put it away it as easy as 3 seconds.

Most People, not if all have cell phones in today's society. Cell phones have not been around for a very long time but they are a key part of our lives. We use cell phones for everything we do day to day such as Texting, Talking, Gaming. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. Cell phones help effectively and without wasting any time in making direct contact with the person.

It is observed that the use of mobile phones during driving, despite an effective means of communication, contributes to an interruption of the driver's attention which increases issues concerning road safety. Drivers that use cell phones could never pay full attention to roads that expose not only themselves but also other people on the road. The research team's results showed that the use of cell phones makes drivers quite exposed to serious crashes while driving. The driver's main emphasis is not on the road or traffic, and even at one time trying to handle the phone and vehicle becomes difficult. During driving, cell phones also reduce drivers' mental capacity, as they fail to focus on minor or major activities that occur around them. Drivers that use cell phones respond slowly and very often make wrong decisions that can trigger fatal accidents affecting other passenger cars. Driving decision making is a vital factor in giving drivers a split second to make a fast decision.

Although there are serious negative impacts of using cell phones while driving, it is also relevant to present advantages for the sake of arguments. The security factor is again the most important benefit of cell phones during driving. Cell phones can provide help during emergencies and drivers can make emergency calls, even reporting any hazardous scenarios such as roadside accidents. A driver can locate the desired route via cell phones. Besides, any use of FMs on cellular phones may provide weather and traffic information. Cell phones help effectively and without wasting any time in making direct contact with the person. There are other ways to distract a driver than cell phones such as talking to passengers, cigarette lighting and smoking, eating, drinking, emergencies presented justifications from both sides of an issue using cell phones during driving, and not using them.

The paper raised points on both sides of the issue using mobile phones while driving, or not using them. I proposed that using cell phones is very dangerous while driving a vehicle because they cause you to lose your distraction while driving and they can cause a serious accident. But as well as that they are good for emergency purposes.",1

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on the daily basis. Many people in today is society who own cell phones operate them while they are driving. Drivers shouldn't be allowed nor able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

The usage of cell phones while operating a vehicle is a very debatable topic. One example of why cell phones should not be used because they take the person is attention off of the road. The usage of a cellular device is dangerous especially when it comes to operating a vehicle. People using a phone will be too focused on it and that could lead to an accident.

Fines have been placed as a consequence for cell phone usage. The fines are to get fewer people to use their phones, but it really is not much of a help. Many think they should be able to use their phones so the fines do not really mean much to them. For example, people say if you do not pay this phone bill then you shouldn't be able to tell me what to do with it. In the other case many people do it without thinking about what could happen and how it could greatly effect themselves or the people around.

Suspension of license is also another consequence of driving while using cell phones. There is so much that can be looked over but it only takes that one time to do it to the point where you are affected. Some people will abide by the rules of driving without the use of a cellular device while there are some who do not. Everyone cannot be spoken for, although the majority can be put into the category of people who use cell phones while driving.

In conclusion, the usage of cell phones has many reason as to why it shouldn't be allowed. In my opinion, it is better to be safe than sorry in any situation that deals with driving. The life is of yourself and others is what really matters at the end of the day. Waiting until you get home or your destination to use your phone should always be the route that's taken. People should always think of others and yourself before you decide to use a cell phone while driving.

The person you are or they have been texting could wait but the car you are driving can't and requires all the alertness you have in order to be safe behind the wheel. Your life and the lives of others are always at stake when you're are driving. There already so many accidents happening on the road and one of those main causes of those accidents happening are caused by people who were texting and driving. There are laws saying that it is illegal for you to be texting and driving.

If you were to cause an accident because you were texting and driving and end someone's life because of that accident you will be held responsible for that person's death and will actually serve time in jail or in prison. Throughout most of the states of the United States of America it is actually very illegal for someone to be texting and driving.

You will actually be charged if you get pulled for texting and driving because you are risking your life and the lives of others on the road.

I personally think that it shouldn't be something people should be doing in general. Mostly because the lives of others are at stake when someone is texting and driving and could actually lose their life because of it. It distracts the driver from focusing on the road and so many things could go wrong on the road whether there is a drunk driver or construction. Texting isn't as important as your life and the lives of other people.

Texting and driving isn't something people should or do in general. Luckily there's laws saying to not text and drive but some people don't listen and there is still risk of accidents happening because of this. People should see the bad side of texting and driving rather than answering someone's text message.",1
"Phones & Driving

Cell phones and driving is not a good combination. See when you're driving you have to pay attention because your life and others depend on it. Therefore, having a cellphone would make that task difficult because it is a distraction. Using your cellphone while driving diverts your attention from the road, causes you to be distracted in three different ways, and causes fatalities for you and others on the road.

One main thing that comes with driving is that you have to pay attention to the road and the people around you. You have to stay aware and alert to not only what you are doing but to what others are doing as well so you can correctly respond safely. However, if you pick up the cellphone for any reason makes it hard for you to do that if you divert your eyes from the road to your cell phone screen. Picking up that cell phone is not worth the disaster you could potentially cause.

Next, using your cell phone while driving distracts you in three different ways: manual, cognitive, and visual. The cell phone distracts you manually when reaching for it to respond to that text message you got or to answer that phone call you're receiving; causing you to take on or more hands off the steering wheel. You're distracted cognitively when your mind is off the road. Cell Phones cause this when you're engaging in the conversation on the phone whether it's via text or call. Lastly, using your cell phone distracts you visually when you check that text message or that notification; causing you to take your eyes off the road. All of this are only three reasons why using your phone while driving is one of the most dangerous activities to participate in while driving.

Furthermore, using your cellphone while driving causes many fatalities. The National Safety Council states that 1.6 million crashes are caused by the driver using their cellphone while driving. Statistics show that crashes caused by cellphones are six times more likely to happen than crashes caused by a drunk driver. In addition one out of four traffic crashes are spurred out of cellphone usage and each day 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving. All could've been prevented if they didn't pick up the phone.

Due to reasons stated above, when you are in your vehicle driving on the road please refrain from picking up your cellular device. There are many ways you can stop yourself from getting distracted by your cell phone. All cellphones have a mute button which you can use every time you step in your car. There are some phones that have a do not disturb button that silences all notifications that are not emergencies. All this you could do to save the life of yourself and someone else.",1
"Many people think texting and driving is a good idea because they think they can multitask. They believe they are above the law and won't get caught. But they don't understand the effects that is causes. There are other people who think texting and driving is a complete no go. I agree with the people who dislike it. There are many reasons why you shouldn't text and drive. To the punishment in the eyes of the law to death.

A lot of individuals have lost their life due to using an electronic while operating a vehicle. In 2015 about 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving drivers whom were distracted. In a yearly basis there are 1.6 million car crashes involving texting and driving. It is also known it is 6 times more likely to cause an accident than a drunk driver. Noting the fact that being on a cellphone while driving equals to having a alcohol level of 0.8.

The justice system comes into this subject because of what punishment would the person receive. Tickets could range from $20 - $500, depending on the state. It could result into a misdemeanor charge. If there is a incident that eventually leads to injury or death to another driver, it could lead to jail/prison time. In Georgia if you are pulled over for this ticket start at $50. It will only increase by 50 each time. It could also lead to getting points on your license as well.

Before you get a ticket for texting and driving do these following things so you wont be temped to text or call someone. Put your phone out of reach. This will prevent you from grabbing it. Download apps that block incoming calls/text. With this app the only tie it will let you text or call back is when you are stopped and parked. If you need to use your phone for directions, invest in a cellphone dash mount. Following these simple things could save your life and possibly others.

Stopping texting and driving is a goal in todays generation. It is also known that texting and driving will never be eliminated. But hopefully a majority of people stop there will be a decrease of accidents. Hopefully the number of fatalities will also go down, causing less people being in jail for possibly injuring someone. By putting phones out of reach or by buying a dashboard mount.",1
"PHONES & Driving

Driving with a cell phone has its pros and cons but it really depends on the driver if driving with a phones is a bad thing. Some people use their cell phone for navigation that could help them get around in an unfamiliar area. The cons of it is that some people may be paying too much attention to their phone and not to the road. Being on your phone could be helpful or dangerous.

The reason it could be help full is that it would be easier to call for roadside assistances. If I were to have a break down I could call to have my car towed away and have a ride home. I also could use it to call for someone else who need roadside assistance and may not have access to it. It can also be used for traffic reports if there's heavy traffic or there's been a wreck and you can call for help.

The reason driving with a phone would be bad is that you could easily be distracted by it and can get in a wreck or cause one. Being on the phone with someone may cause you not to hear someone honking at you. Teens should not be able to have their phones in hand while driving since they use their phone the most.

If I were to make laws I would pass a law saying that people under the age of 21 shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving. I would make it cause usually the ones under 21 are the main one son social media the most and could even get distracted by a simple notification.",1
"In today's society everyone uses their cell phones everywhere and anytime. They have become the main source of our communication, entertainment and even education. People tend to use cell phones everywhere. Even when they are driving. The question is, should cellphones be used while operating a vehicle? My answer is no and this is why.

Cell phones have taken away from attention and respect. All persons cell phone etiquette varies. My grandmother only uses her cell phone when sitting at home similar to when she had a landline phone. On the other hand, my mother uses her cell phone all day and night and appears to be upset whenever her cell phone usage is interrupted. I find myself drifting away on my cell phone while in the middle of doing homework and even while cleaning.

In the article ""2019 texting and driving Statistics"" the US Department of Transportation reported that ""cell phone use while driving kills up to 3,000-6,000 people every year"" (Miller and Zois, 2019 ). This is because when checking your notifications which seems to only require a quick glance down at your phone, that is all the time it takes to cause an accident. I have personally experienced being in a vehicle with a distracted driver that was attempting to reply to a text message and slowly lost control of the car's position in a lane. What if a car in the opposite lane was doing the same thing at the same time? We could have collided easily. Have you ever been driving just to be stopped at a light longer than the light is red? That would be compliments of another distracted driver in front of you and looking down at their phone instead of up at the light. Then there's the distracted driver that missed the bike rider parallel to them simply because of taking their eyes off of the road briefly.

The thought of having your emails, social media and even a dictionary right in the palm of your hand has to be the best invention of the new millenium. With that being said, it causes us to adapt to checking those many notifications instantly. Even our parents are pleased with the ability to access their children at any time and any place. So much so that even my mother expects a speedy reply or answer, even during times of school or work. Car makers even started to incorporate cell phone usage during driving with the bluetooth features and auxiliary cords. Now rather than drivers texting, they have begun sifting through their various playlist and music apps rather than listening to the radio.

Lastly, we have the unpredictable emergencies that happen on the roads. If we are distracted by our cell phones, that causes a delay in our reaction to emergencies. I've often been driving myself and witnessed another driver having a tire blow out. If I was distracted by my phone, that would have prevented my quick thinking and ability to avoid the collision. I have also driven behind cars with missing brake lights. The only way I knew they were about to stop was because of my ability to visually scan my surroundings and to be aware of when the light changes or if I need to quickly switch lanes to avoid hitting them from behind. What about the recent incident of a tree collapsing on the highway? If everyone was distracted everyone's ability to react would be compromised causing an even larger highway collision.

In conclusion, I am anti-cell phone usage while driving. The bottom line is when you are driving the operation of that vehicle should be your only concern. Things can happen in an instance and you have to be fully alert to react, resist, or prevent from colliding with other cars. Texting and scrolling on social media can wait until you're at your destination. Think of it this way, to use my phone while driving could mean life or death. If you ever thought about a friend you forgot to call back or a text to reply to it can wait. A prompt response is not worth your life or the lives of the people around you. Remember, states nationwide are turning into Hands Free states with a law that requires you to be free of any device while driving. If anything else, a reply is not worth the fine or the points on your license.

"Its 11 am, and you're driving to your favorite restaurant to get lunch, you decide to check your phone while driving to text your friend; as you're typing your message, you run a red light and get side-swiped by another car. Texting while driving can lead to a potentially fatal series of events; not only for you, but for others around you.

Many people think they should be safe if they only check their phones for a short period of time. This is negligent of the fact that a quick glance at their phone could be all it takes to get into an accident. If you're driving on a highway, and decide to check your phone for a minute; the distance you would travel without looking at the road would be the length of up to 500 cars.

Imagine how many accidents you could get into if you consider the fact that people need to slow down, or change lanes.

Not only does texting pose a danger, the constant thought of notifications, and texts that you might be alerted to can be dangerous. If you can't focus on driving, and you keep getting notified of more and more texts or social media feed updates, you would be more convinced to check your phone. The safest thing to do would be to keep your phone on ""do not disturb"" or ""silent"". If you don't think about your phone, the safer you will be as the temptation to use or check your phone would be diminished.

Now you might be thinking, ""What if there's an emergency, and I need to be contacted immediately?"". The safest thing to do would be to utilize what most cars come with, the ability to call someone without using your phone directly. In that case, instead of being texted, you could call, or be called. If you're on a phone call, you can still keep your eyes on the road, and there's less of a danger.

Drivers should be allowed to keep their phones on them while driving, but be limited to only calling. You can easily call someone without taking your eyes off the road in most cases; if you have a car that can act as the medium to call someone.",1
"It is illegal to text and drive. Some people think it is okay to text and drive. However, there also is a group of people who feel that texting and driving shouldn't be allowed at all. Some people feel that if you know what you are doing that you should be able to text and drive. I personally feel as if texting and driving is okay. To an extent, some people should be allowed to text and drive.

To start off, I personally feel that texting and driving is okay. Part of me feeling that way is because I am a minor and always have my phone with me. Another reason why I feel that texting and driving is okay is because people make phones seem like they are the worst creation to exist when they actually have made positive impacts on societies. What if someone you care about is in an emergency? They could send you their location and you can go to help them.

Using your phone when you drive isn't as bad as it seems. That is if you you're mature enough to use your phone behind the wheel.

What I mean by being mature behind the wheel is that you shouldn't be texting on your phone is traffic is bad and stop signs are off. You shouldn't text and drive when you're

Getting a text saying ""Are you going to the party on Friday?"" However, if you come up to a red light and you get an important text, that would be fine to text back. Another reason that texting and driving is okay is that if need directions somewhere you can have someone text you for directions. People today use their phones for a gps. Some people aren't from the area they're in so they need directions. Me personally I use my phone for a gps when driving in an area I'm not familiar with because im not going to get lost and wind up somewhere I shouldn't be.

As good is texting and driving is for some people, it is also just as bad. Texting and driving can lead to car accidents. If you're texting and looking down at the road and there's someone reckless who runs their red light and crashes into you. Now your in an accident u probably could have avoided because you were looking at your phone. However, some gps apps help you avoid things ahead. Also if you feel as if someone is following you and you know your near a friend's house, you can let them know your being followed and your coming to their house and they need to come out to make sure you're okay. Texting and driving can help you avoid situations that you wouldn't be able to avoid if you didn't have a phone.

In conclusion, texting a driving isn't always a bad thing. You just have to know how to be responsible if you do it. You can't text someone when a traffic light is off. Next thing you know you'll end up getting hit.",1
"PHONES & DRIVING

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Cell phones have not been around for a very long time; they have become a key part of our lives. So many people now days use their cell phone for just about everything such as: texting, talking, face time, and games. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

People these days rely heavily on cell phones to perform daily activities. Cell phone are used for phone calls, email, sending text messages, and performing other tasks.

As a result, an increase of accidents and fatalities have occurred because of the use of cellular phones while driving. It should be banned before more deaths calculate for something that can be avoided. However, the dangers present themselves when we get behind the wheel of a car and carry these habits of cell phone addictions with us. A usage of a cell phone should not be displayed at any point while driving. It can wait many have had accidents even deaths because of reading or of writing a simple text messages. No text is worth dying for.

In conclusion, cell phones should be banned while driving including text messaging, talking on the phone and use of electronic gadgets for cell phones. The consequences include the dangerous effect on health, financial stresses and injuries. Cell phones should be banned (except in emergency) while driving my personal suggestion would be that car manufacturing companies should install a cell phone signal jammer to avoid a serious accident in future.",1
"Teen Driving

We all remember that teams are tied to their cell phones, which is why texting and driving is such a great fear. Most teenagers don't find the real risk of texting while driving, as these texting and driving facts for teenagers can appear. Distracted driving is the hot-button subject matter, particularly when it comes to the younger generations. We get attached to our cell phone while behind this machine, but adolescent drivers are the worst offenders. This is a scary idea, as distracted driving is dangerous and harmful on its own. However add that with the ignorance of the teenage driver and we are talking about a real dangerous combination.

To start off, even though the risk of texting while driving are well-documented, that has done very little to stop adolescent drivers from doing so. Some people question why there are so many commercials about texting and driving. That is one of these numerous reasons. teenagers and even adults don't consider how dangerous it actually is. The fact of the matter is that texting while driving takes the persons away from the road, severely increasing the chances of a crash. Moreover, teenagers that text while driving are proven to be out of this way within 10% of their overall driving period, as their thoughts are off the road and they aren't paying attention to the direction of their vehicle.

secondly, the fact that teen drivers are usually the least skilled motorist on the road may make the information about texting while driving that much more difficult to tell, considering that most teens think that they are very skilled at what they are doing.

some states have attempted to enforce that texting while driving was bad among teens and adolescent drivers by establishing a particular band against the practice. Some states have still yet to give such a cell phone ban for inexperienced drivers. According to, Teensafeblog ""11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. Teen drivers are four times more likely than adults to get into car accidents while texting or talking on the cell phone. this shows how connected and attached we are to our cell phones no matter where we are at the risk that can take place. Some teams have even put on themselves that texting at a stoplight is okay because you are not moving and no one can be in danger. This is not true. You need to have just as much attention on the road when at a stop light as if you're on the road moving. you need to be cautious of your surroundings and who is around you at all times, even when halted at a stoplight.",1
"Phones have come a very long way since 1973, phones have gave us the power to communicate with someone miles far away. People fell more in love with them once the first touchscreen phone came out. Now people have to have one, all you see nowadays is people walking or driving with their phone glued to their eyes. Major companies come out with a new one every year and they come out with one that has better features, a bigger screen, and a new software.

Cars have been out for many years and car accidents have happened a lot in each year. Accidents due to phone usage leads to 1.6 million deaths and that should be lowered each year. More and more people still use their phones while driving but it's a bigger percent of adults who use them while operating a vehicle. The people driving think they can multitask but imagine just driving to the store down the street and you look at your phone for a quick second, but then when you look up all you see is your life flashing in front of you. I don't think driving and using a phone is eligible at any time because driving safely is better than taking a life.

Drivers should be more cautious when driving because you never know if the person next to you is using the phone while driving. Georgia came out with a law this year where if you get caught with a phone while driving you will get a ticket. Georgia is starting to take more responsibility on the hands free law which is good because we are getting tired of hearing someone's son or daughter being ran over due to a driver not looking at the road when they need to. Adults who have been through that are probably in jail and some say they can't live with it on their conscious, they feel the pain they put the child's family through. They encourage people to please put the phone down while driving because they say it's not worth looking at a text and taking a life.

The rate of jail inmates keeps raising and in order to drop this number we as people have to encourage people to stop texting and driving. People feel bad about losing someone due to this situation but then go on the road while using the phone in an operating vehicle. Once reality hits them in that moment I think people would than start to make a change. Cars should have a sensor where if it detects that you are on the phone the car will automatically not cut on and won't let you drive until your phone is put up. If the car detects that you're on the phone while driving it will automatically pull over and cut off and won't cut on until you put it away.

That is my thoughts on driving and texting it shouldn't be allowed. Death numbers keep rising every year due to this situation and it should come to an end.",1
"Over thousands of people have died from car accidents due to texting and driving. They pay attention to their phone more than the road. Texting and driving is bad because it causes a lot of accidents, it can cause a lot of deaths, and could harm a lot of people.

Texting and driving cause a lot of car accidents. While you're replying to someone on the phone you aren't looking at the road. You can cause damage to people and even kill people from not paying attention to the road. According to google over 1.6 million car crashes happen all over the world and is putting a dent in the human population. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

Each day, 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving. 2.35 million people in the US are injured or disabled by car crashes every year. More than 330,000 of these crashes that cause severe injury are caused by texting and driving. This means that over 78% of all distracted drivers are distracted because they have been texting while driving.

Texting and driving can also harm the people around you. In the accident you could kill someone around you because you're not paying attention to the road. Just from texting and driving over 2 million people are in an accident and 500 thousand people are injured and over 15 thousand people died from car crashes due to texting and driving.

Texting and driving is a very dangerous topic. A lot of people are hurt and also died from texting and driving related accidents. Texting and driving causes a lot of accidents, causes a lot of death throughout the world, and it also can harm people around the accident who are hurt from collateral damage.",1
"No Texting On the Road: Eliminating Distractions on the Roads

In today's society, everyone is forced to find ways to be the most productive they can possibly be in order to complete their daily tasks.

Commutes to work are longer and the accessibility of cell phones has never been so handy, but also so life-threatening.

People spend so much time in their cars, multitasking, especially in terms of checking messages and emails while in the car, is becoming a norm in society (Teen Driver Source).

But texting and checking messages, unfortunately, is not as harmless as people assume it to be when they are checking their social media feeds during standstill traffic or at a stoplight.

Just in 2013 alone, there were more than 1.2 million car crashes in America and of those 1.2 million, nearly 341,000 of those were caused solely by texting (Teen Driver Source).

Cell phones in the car are more than just a distraction, but a danger to the driver of the vehicle as well as everyone else on the road.

Some states within the United States of America have banned using their cell phones while driving, such as Illinois, but not every state has yet.

When one is distracted on the road, their attention to detail decreases, their reaction time slows, and they are more susceptible to accidents than they were before picking up their phones.

When it comes to driving on the roads, the use of cell phones while driving should not be legal around the country because it increases dangers on the road, increases driver stress, and it damages our brain health over time.

The first and most obvious reason as to why using cell phones on the road comes down to the fact that being distracted leads to potentially more accidents.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conducts surveys every single year.

During 2017, 3,166 people died due to distracted driving (Federal Communications Commission).

Distracted driving entails more than just texting, but when further studies were conducted as to the specific causes of the deaths and/or accidents on the roads, more information supports the dangers of cell phone use.

Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) performed a study that found the average amount of time a person takes their eyes off the road when receiving a text is 4.6 seconds, and a lot can happen in that short amount of time (It Still Works).

The person in front of the driver could brake suddenly and if the driver is not alert and paying attention, they could end up rear ending the person ahead of them.

If the numbers regarding deaths on the road in relation to cell phone use are not as shocking as one might think them to be, it's important to analyze the total number of accidents instead to provide more clarity on the subject matter.

Just in a single day alone, according to the Federal Communications Commission, 9 people die in accidents and nearly 1,000 people are injured every single day as a result of distracted drivers (Federal Communications Commission).

Over the total year, that's nearly 365,000 injuries and over 3,000 deaths because of people becoming distracted on the road.

If that's not telling of the dangers of texting or checking phones while behind the wheel, then taking a look at how it can impact a single driver is significant to this argument as well.

With distractions, the level of stress drivers may feel on the roads increase.

When it comes to new drivers, this is a very serious issue, as they are both new to the roads and inexperienced in the typical driving routine.

New drivers have a lot to worry about, and adding the stress of text messages or phone notifications makes it more difficult to be safe and present when behind the wheel.

For new drivers and parents alike, there are several recommendations that the Teen Driver Source makes: complete calls or texts prior to getting into the car, get directions and figure out how to get to your destination beforehand, and check in with friends or family only after arrival (Teen Driver Source).

All of these are great tips for new drivers to remain safe while behind the wheel, but texting poses a threat to their attention on the roads, as well as the added stress placed upon them, on top of remembering all the other new skills they are learning as new drivers.

42% of high school students, in a recent study on Teen Driver Source conducted in 2015, admitted that they texted within the last 30 days (Teen Driver Source).

Multitasking promotes more stress, as told by many studies accumulated by organizations studying drivers and their habits while on the road, and for new drivers, attention to detail is imperative (It Still Works).

If high school students admitted to driving and texting at the same time, many of them also admitted that they forgot to wear their seatbelt while driving, which further would increase their risk of injury, or in the worst case scenario, death (Teen Driver Source).

Those under the age of 20 years old are more prone to distracted driving, so it is important to take matters into their own hands (It Still Works).

Teens and all drivers alike are encouraged to not only put their phone away and take care of tasks before turning the key in the ignition, but to also put their phone on Do Not Disturb, a feature available from nearly every phone today (Teen Driver Source).

Eliminating stress and being entirely present in the activity of driving is a must, and for new drivers and experienced drivers alike, if everyone can be mindful of their habits on the roads, stress will decrease, as well as optimal brain usage.

In terms of health, using cell phones while driving is not a great decision for anyone.

Cell phone use while driving has been said to reduce brain activity by about 36% while on the roads, which contributes to a greater risk of injury and/or death and accidents (Teen Driver Source).

Over time, however, this habit could contribute to other areas of life.

Using cell phones while driving could translate to other aspects of a person's life, leading to what could be perceived as an addiction to technology.

Without constant connection to cellular devices, it could not only impact someone's attention on the roads, someone's brain health and optimization, but also what could become of someone's productivity.

This is not just a matter of driving, but a matter of quality of life.

Would it be productive or even healthy for someone to spend their entire lives glued to their phone, inattentive to the world around them?

When it comes to driving on the roads, the answer is clear: using cell phones while driving leads to less productivity and alertness, and the consequences are immediately present.

If society does not take accountability for one's deliberate attention to detail while on the road, there's more at risk than just one missed text or a late work assignment.

People's lives and health are at stake, as well as the quality of their daily routine.

Alas, cell phones are a great part of the world today, but they do not need to hold a great place of importance when behind the wheel.

It's more than just health and brain related issues or even the amount of stress drivers of all experiences face, but it's about danger.

Is it worth the risk to send that text to a friend while on the way to one's destination?

There's advertisements, stories, news articles, and movies about the topic floating around, but some people don't take it as seriously as it needs to be.

It's not about collective action, or rather many people doing the same thing at once, but about many people deciding to take action on their own accord.

So, it is up the individual: take action and be safe, or increase the risk for not only one person, but the lives of the many people one might face on their daily commute.

It's all a choice, but either way, the future will show the consequences of what society decides to make of this information.

"Phones & Driving

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. A growing body of research shows that driving while using a cellphone can create dangerous distractions. However, many states do not have bans against the use of phones while none have forbidden the use of hands-free devices. Opponents of the idea claim that cellphone bans are difficult to enforce while others claim that drivers also engage in other distracting activities such as eating, listening to music, and arguing with their children. Nevertheless, a review of the statistics indicates that cell phone use, even hands-free increases the likelihood of fatal incidents which provides justification for the bans.

Hundreds of research studies across the world have highlighted the various risks of cell phone use among drivers. Having conversations on a phone while driving increases the likelihood of fatal incidents by 400% (Walsh et al. 1896). Therefore, cell phone use creates more risk than other distractions such as reading billboards or having conversations with passengers. A study sponsored by the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis concluded that use of phones while driving contributed to 6% of crashes (Delgado et al. 17). Texting and driving also present a significant problem especially among the younger generations. Research shows that drivers using mobile phones decrease their visual scans of the road, have a higher probability of weaving in their lanes on bends, and have slower reactions to hazards due to having one hand off the wheel.

The act of conversation itself also creates a distraction. While focusing on the road requires a certain amount of cognitive processing, the complexity of conversations also engages cognitive resources. MRIs indicate that during driving, people exhibit extensive stimulation in the parietal lobe of the brain mainly associated with spatial processing. However, when performing dual tasks, such as having a conversation, activity in the temporal lobes rises significantly signifying processing of auditory stimuli (Fitch et al. 712). The rise in temporal lobe activity corresponds to a large reduction in parietal-lobe activation which indicates that conversations require more attention which is diverted away from the driving task. If a driver chooses to prioritize a conversation, then it reduces their focus on the road, thereby increasing the likelihood of a crash. While some may argue that the use of hands-free devices reduces the risk of a crash, research provides contradictory results. A study on the cognitive effects of talking on cellphones concluded that while participants often crashed while chatting, drunk drivers had reduced likelihood of a crash (Lipovac et al. 136).

Current legislation on cell phone use while driving is limited as legislators do not acknowledge the risks of both hand-held and hands-free cell phones. Moreover, opponents of the motion claim that such laws are unenforceable due to the resources required to monitor all drivers. However, a review of a person's billing records can determine whether they were using a phone while driving. Moreover, aggressive enforcement may also deter other drivers from risky activities.

Despite the risks associated with cell phone use while driving, most states remain hesitant to implement appropriate bans. Statistics indicate that cell phone use accounts for a significant portion of car crashes due to the limited focus on the road. Bans would work to increase awareness of the dangers in addition to reducing fatal incidences.

"Phones and driving,The main meaning behind a phone is to have communication that's why it was created now the question is should we or should we not use our phones during driving. We need our phones for one thing and that's calling,Anything else other than calling could may or may not result in a crash or even death. Phones today are mostly used with teenager behind the wheel and there has been many accidents of teenagers using their phones while driving. Phones theses days cause many distractions while driving but that is their choice to pull out their phone while driving. So in my opinion i think we should have our phones while driving,so now let me explain why.

Phones,Now a days we use phones for many other things other than calling. Our phones has been changing and still changing and adding more options other than communication such as apps. Apps are mobile applications that you can download on your phone. There are just so many things that we can do on our phones,we may wanna take a picture while we on the road or we may wanna watch a movie on our phone but like i said before we need our phones for many reasons and i'm not just speaking teenagers i'm speaking for everybody because now a days we live and run on our phones so only thing i can really say about texting or anything

That has to do with a phone in driving is stay safe.

Conclusion,in my opinion everyone doesn't need to have a phone while driving but no one is going to make a law saying we shouldn't have a phone while driving. It's just not gonna happen because it would not be a suitable law to create when everyone around the whole world has phones and use them while driving. We the people are just gonna have to be more careful when behind the wheel while driving.",1
"Essay 2: phones and driving

Everyday people die in car accidents and or get injured very badly because they use cell phones while driving. It is illegal in many states and it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive because these actions could lead to vehicle crashes. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

One reason drivers should not use cellphones while texting and driving is because it is illegal in most states. If drivers are caught using their cellphones while driving they will be forced to pay a fine. Fines can cost from $20 to $250 dollars depending on different aspects. This fine is supposed to intimidate people when they use a cell phone while driving. People need to take caution of their surroundings so there are no wrecks; therefore, if you look down at your phone even for just a second a lot could happen which is why you need to be more alert while driving.

Another reason why not to use a cellphone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are much less dangerous. For example, the earpiece can be used to accept calls and to talk into this way you can keep both hands on the steering wheel. Do not have both earpieces in so you can listen out for other vehicles and your surrounding. Another hands free device is a car kit, if you do not have one in your car you can always buy one. Car kit is basically a touch screen radio and instead of texting you can voice your text to the carkit. It is okay to use your phone as long as your car is in p (park).

In conclusion, you should not use a cellphone while driving because it is illegal, it can lead to vehicle crashes. There are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you normally answer calls or texts when driving, stop and think about your life and other peoples life that you could put in danger before answering that phone call or text.",1
"Texting While Whipping . .

Driving a car doesn't take that much IQ but then you couldn't say that because why would there be so many crashes per minute. No, driving is hard if you're bad at concentrating on more than one thing. Driving is a whole nether set of skills and it's not as easy but then knowing that your bad at one thing collides with your crazy fast texting skills makes you comfortable doing something dumb like texting and driving. That doesn't really level out with your driving skills but not everyone knows that! But then your mom texts you while you're switching lanes on i85 then BAM! You find yourself playing bumper cars at 79mph barely ending it all! Driving while texting isn't good for everybody but it certainly ant for everyone!

Some of these newer cars have addressed the fully automated phone utilizing Siri or even Alexa! This is probably one of the best things cars now days have to offer. Say you're driving and your mom text you, instead of playing bumper cars you could just tell your car what to reply back to mother! It's actual against the law not to have that feature in your car, not really but it should be. When you are doing your driving focusing is a level you have to raise the bar in and the more help you get on avoiding distractions the better.

Driving while texting is very, dangerous, bad, stupid, fun, and life threating! Being fun because we like to get that rush of sending a whole paragraph while still not playing bumper cars with other drivers on the road. Getting that excitement that you were texting and driving and totally avoided a bad accident or even someone's specific instruction that told you texting and driving was bad gives some people a little additive rush! However, just because you got away with it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, who's to say you won't get away with it on Sunday?

More than 50% of car deaths comes from distractions and more than 50% of those distractions comes from cell phones. Cell phones are nice to have but not while driving. Driving should have a way for you to put your phone down in a slot just for you to start driving. It is very dangerous and you could be risking your life and others as well around you. Driving with your phone out isn't good but when your eye sight goes to your phone instead of the road there is almost always something bad on the verge.

When on the road your attention has to be there as well! You have to understand that you're not the only one on the road and that individuals with families and kids that enjoy living want to keep living. When it's hard enough to concentrate on the road it gets 10 times harder to do so when having another screen in front of you. If you get caught with a phone in your hand while driving by and police officer they should react the same way as if your seatbelt were off! Safety and living will always come first. Phones are not needed at the wheel, your attention is!

"Driving & Phones

For a couple of years now a lot of people have been dying, getting hurt, and a lot of car crashes happen because of texting and driving. No one ever realizes what texting and driving can do to a person and anyone on the road. If there is one person on their phone around a bunch of other cars that puts everyone else in danger no matter what. The phones is what gets everyone killed on the road because it is such a distraction to people behind the wheel and they don't have the patience to get somewhere then check it. Phones are pretty much taking over a lot of peoples life's because they are so hooked to it.

In my personal opinion people should not be able to use their cell phones while driving or when operating any kind of vehicle. It puts the person using the phone and all of the other pedestrians around them. Every cell phone company should make all their phones have censors in them for when people start driving their vehicles and would make the phone unusable. The worst part is that people could carless about the other people about themselves. That's why there is so many deaths coming from crashes because there is always that one person that is on their phone and not looking where they're going.

The fact that everything is on your cell phone makes it worse because you receive a notification and you automatically have to check it. People nowadays do not have the patience to wait to get somewhere to answer the message or whatever they receive. Everyone is basically addicted to their phones which isn't a good thing at all because as technology gets better maybe it could fix the being on your phone while driving or it can make it worse. If cell phone companies were to find a way to put sensors in a phone and then when they sensor you using your phone it automatically locks it. That would put all of the drivers in a better environment because now they won't have to worry about getting hit by a driver that is too busy distracted on their phone.

Putting sensors into phones won't be a bad idea but not everyone will buy the latest phone and getting drivers to not use their phone while driving will probably impossible. Companies can also change that if u get a notification it says it out loud so you won't have to pick your phone up. They could also make it to where you can only answer phone calls if someone wants to contact you instead of receiving text messages. Although they did pass a law where you get pulled over and given a ticket they are still not stopping texting and driving. There will still be those couple of people that still use their phones.

Basically to sum everything into one paragraph I was talking about how texting and driving is so distracting and putting all of the people around them in danger. It is not safe at all to be using your phone while driving and even if you are at a stop at a red light you still shouldn't pull it out to check something on it. When getting a notification you should just wait until you get to your destination and then check and answer it. Even with saying all of that people still won't understand how many people they are putting in danger and only worry about them selves. Just don't text and drive and wait till you get somewhere to answer the text or whatever you received.",1
"Phones & Driving

Cell phones are a part of everyone's life in the twenty first century. Society uses them for everything from keeping up with social media, remaining in contact with people, personal entertainment and so much more. With so many people in possession of a cell phone, it is no surprise that they use them at inappropriate times. One of those times is while driving, the use of a cell phone while driving is not only dangerous but irresponsible. I think drivers should not use their phone while behind the wheel.

Driving while on a cell phone is almost as bad as driving while under the influence. In the article LiveScience, it says; ""Studies show that driving while talking on a cell phone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a four times greater risk of a crash,"" said Janet Froetscher, president and CEO of the NSC. ""Driving drunk is also dangerous and against the law. When our friends have been drinking, we take the car keys away. It's time to take the cell phone away"". This shows that not only is driving while on the phone four times more dangerous than driving without a cell phone but it is also as dangerous as drunk driving. Cell phone use while driving is also common amongst teen drivers. According to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ""3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States"". This statistic shows that multitasking behind the wheel is dangerous and becoming a life-long risk. Knowing these statistics drivers should take more caution and families should take control of this risk.

People might argue that they should have their own choice whether to use a cell phone while driving. In the article , Stop Texting and Driving ""Since each driver recognizes the potential dangers they could involve themselves with if they choose to text and drive, a law should not dictate a ban on texting and driving behind the wheel."" This statement from the article shows that people think they should have their own choice if they want to text and drive and it shouldn't be a law. Humans will always make mistakes while driving. In the the article FEE it says; Earlier government studies have repeatedly found other distractions to pose a far more serious problem than phone-related distraction. According to 2010 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, cell phone distraction has barely budged as a fatal crash factor, ranked behind drivers being ""lost in thought."" This has not led to calls for nationwide prohibitions on daydreaming while driving"". In the year of 2010, cell phone use while driving wasn't the most dangerous thing to do while driving.

In the article THE ZEBRA, texting while driving statistics from 2012-2018 say that ""14% of distracted driving deaths were attributed specifically to cell phone use, as opposed to other forms of distracted driving.""

"Driving while texting is very dangerous for people on the roads. Millions of people have died from car accidents and texting while driving. I don't have driver license yet but I will be safe on the road when I get them . I have been in car accidents because other people were not paying attention and hit our car . I am glad they created the Hands-Free law to keep us safe .

The Hands-Free law was created to keep people from communicating while behind the wheel . If you have something to tell someone it can wait until you pull over . Car accidents happens everyday on the interstate because people are not aware of their surroundings . I would agree with people using their phone behind the wheel only for emergencies. Most people are not good with multitasking and driving .

I have drove while on my phone only to run an errand. I was bored so I called my friend to figure out other plans . I was safe while using my phone nothing happened. Although, that doesn't make chances short it won't happen next time . I will be more careful next time to decision or drunk drivers to .",1
"Phones & Driving

Using a cell phone while operating a vehicle of any stature is a bad decision and should be illegal worldwide. Not only is using a cell phone while driving irresponsible, it's also dangerous to yourself, as well as others on the road. If one does choose to talk, text, or even try and use their cellular device while driving should be penalized to an extent and given a heavy warning. Though a warning, ticket, or even time served may be all it takes to prevent potentially fatal accidents on the road, these methods don't always work. Therefore we, as citizens, and as drivers, should be careful and wise with our decisions.

Reasons why driving and using your cell phone is so dangerous spans on and on. Firstly, one's not fully capable of providing one hundred percent of their attention to a single task such as driving while using their phone. Due to this, using your phone while driving only widens the window for a potential wreck, whether fatal or not. Studies show that using a cell phone and driving has become one of the top leading causes of car crashes in the past twenty years. Secondly, when one is distracted on the road, they put people in danger without even realizing it. There have been many instances where someone who is using their phone, ends up tailgating the vehicle ahead of them, with that vehicle potentially having an entire family in it. Many fatal crashes have been caused by this very action, injuring or even killing those involved in the wreck simply because someone wants to talk, text, or look at social media. So please, if you're driving, try and restrain from using your cell phone until you are parked in a secure location.

Not only is there a wide range of dangers when using your phone and driving, there's also a long list of punishments that follow close behind. One of the main punishments for driving and using your phone is a fine. These fines can range anywhere from $150 to $500 or more depending on how many offenses you have. With such pricey fines, you'd think one would think twice before using their phone while operating a vehicle, but this isn't always the case. To counter this, those who repeat such actions can have their driver's license suspended for up to 90 days. Washington was the first to ban texting and driving state-wide with 38 other states following soon after. Some fines received in these states range from the minimum of $20 to a maximum of $10,000 and one year in prison. The average fine being around $150 to $375 in a handful of states. Insurance is another issue when it comes to using your phone while driving, with the coverage cost on your vehicle being affected. You see, the more of a risk you are on the road, the more you must pay on your insurance, so please drive safely.

Those who aren't fond of dangerous drivers should know how to avoid them and stay out of harm's way. One smart and helpful way to steer clear of those pesky drivers is to alert authorities. If you can, it's smart to try and obtain enough information about the driver and their vehicle such as a description of the driver or license plate. Calling 911 can be what saves you or someone else on the road from a potential accident. Another good way to prevent potential accidents is to travel when traffic is at its lowest. Driving in the early hours of the day can be a good time to drive, as well as work hours just before the lunch-rush. One would want to limit the amount of traffic on the road as much as possible in order to decrease the possibility of encountering dangerous drivers. Lastly, one simply needs to stay on high alert when driving. It seems like a no-brainer, yet many tend to not follow this basic rule of driving. Pay attention to details such as the speed you and those around you are going. Conditions on the road are also important, such as rain, snow, and ice. Remember that simply paying attention to the smaller details can prevent accidents on the road.

Whether or not you believe using your phone while operating a vehicle is as dangerous as it's portrayed to be, one cannot deny that it is a potential hazard. Many car crashes have occurred whilst using a phone and has become one of the leading causes of accidents on the road. Not only is it dangerous, but it is also illegal in most states and one could also be fined a hefty amount. It's simply a bad idea to text, talk, and overall use your phone while driving. Many tend to put responsible drivers in danger through these acts and fail to realize it until it's too late. Remember to drive responsibly, paying attention to those around you and how you drive. Your phone is not worth a life.",1
"Should drivers be able to operate a cell phone while driving? No, drivers should not use a cell phone while driving a moving vehicle. Its dangerous and very risky because you can be seriously hurt or be killed from anything once you take your eyes off the road.

Statistics show that multitasking behind the wheel is life threatening.

Talking, texting, or checking social media while driving takes the brain off the task of driving and can put you in a bad situation as an result. Its very dangerous for you and passengers in the car. Most importantly children if they are along with you inside the vehicle. Once your eyes are taken off the road , you're putting everyone's life in danger no matter the reason for why you took them off the road. If you take your eyes off the road for not even a second , then BOOM, you're flipped over inside your car and whoever is in the car with you is either dead or severely injured.

Using your mobile phone while driving can cause a number of bad things to happen. For example, a car crash. You could be changing a song on your phone and the out of nowhere a car pulls out in front of you going slow and you ram him or her in the back because you was on the phone while operating a moving vehicle. And when you and the other car make contact your car flips or the one you hit flips.

Anybody can be hurt.. even by standers, that's why its important to focus on the task at hand which is driving. This is the only way the prevent mistakes from happening and could save your life and others.",1
"""In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you."" And that quote is by Sharon Heit, mother of texting and driving victim. This essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There is a lot of pros and cons, on if people should or shouldn't be able to use their cell phone well operating a vehicle. As a teenager I see the good and the bad, but it doesn't always means that us teenagers will always listen or bother to do the right thing.

In my opinion cell phones use while driving shouldn't be allowed. Manly because there are more cons then there are pros. And if I was driving I wouldn't be able to text anyone because I can't multitask. And if I got into a car accident I wouldn't be able to handle hurting anyone or possibly killing someone. And I'm the type of person that don't like pain or going to the hospital.

If you don't keep your attention on the road bad things can happen. Including put others life's in danger, putting your life in danger, braking hearts of others and sometimes you're on heart, going to court if the victim try's to sue you. An example of putting other peoples life in danger, let's say if your boyfriend or girlfriend texted you and you saw it and you replied, and you happen to take both hands off the wheel and it happen that you can't take control of the vehicle and you get in a car crash. Taken both hands off the wheel can also put you in danger as well. And getting into a car crash isn't always safe people can die on the scene and you couldn't do anything about it, so that brakes others heart and possible yours.

The pros of cellphone used while driving: navigation, traffic reports, crime reporting, communication with a friend or a parents or if you have children. Now days, the cars have navigation in them. And if they don't you can have cellphone holders for your phone. Communication with a friend or even a family member about something that's going on, and you're trying to get to where they are. And if you have children and you don't know where they are and you're trying to get a hold of them.

This essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. And I don't think people should drive and use there cell phone. There can be exception for using a phone when operated a vehicle. The exception can be about a death or a child, and of course navigation. And this is my opinion on if people should or shouldn't be able to operate a vehicle while driving.",1
"Technology has advance so much within the last couple of years. It is crazy how people have easy access to it and are eligible to communicate with each other very quickly. Cell phones are the main source of communication and to this day everyone can not seem to get their eyes off their phone. In many aspects it is good that everyone has a form of device to get around because they do come in handy. Although technology is highly beneficial and has changed the way certain things are being done, it is important that people use it when it is the correct time. A cell phone itself consist of many helpful applications but there are some moments where cell phones should not be in one's hand and that is when they are driving.

Texting while driving is very distracting because the driver does not have full focus on the road. Within this situation, the driver has a very high chance in getting themselves in a car accident. The amount of car accidents that are caused by texting and driving are enormous according to article, ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving"" (texting and driving statistics). It is better to see a problem and avoid it then to just continue to follow through. When people are texting and driving, they are clearly putting their own life at risk which is awful. When the driver takes their eyes off the road, they are most likely asking for something bad. Even then it is proven that texting and driving is worse than an intoxicated person driving, as proclaimed, ""One study by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) concluded that texting while driving is six times more dangerous than driving while intoxicated"" (Steward law offices). People whom have a very easy temptation to touch their phone should not be driving just as those whom intoxicate themselves and then chose to drive. Ones life is at high risk and since this is a problem that is preventable, everyone should follow through because it endangers someone else's life.

When texting and driving not only is the life of the driver at risk, but also somebody else's. Imagine losing someone or being injured just because one could not put their phone down. It is important to at least be considerate because the numbers of texting and driving have just been going up, as enhance, ""The United States Department of Transportation reported the cell phones are involved in a whopping 1.6 million auto crashes each year"" (Teen Safe).

Enable for these numbers to go down, everyone needs to take put their phone down. As evidence shows, it is dangerous to be on your phone rather to be intoxicated which means being on your cell phone and driving should be banned all over the world. One may assume because drinking and driving is a crime so would be texting and driving, but in worst matters it is not. In the U.S there are some states that have acted, ""Currently, a patchwork of laws governs cell-phone usage by drivers. Some 35 states ban text messaging while driving, 30 states ban cell-phone use by novice drivers, and 10 bans all use of hand-held cell phones, according to the NTSB"" (CNN). Although not all states have contributed to this law enforcement yet, some people should at least take this as advice. There could be countries that my not take this into consideration, but it is important that everyone does what is right so not everyone's life is at risk. When driving the driver should withhold full focus on the road and not on their cellphone.

Cell phone use while driving sets a distraction for the driver. It enhances them to multitasks which is nearly impossible to keep full attention on both the road and cellphone. It is better to drive safe then to live a miserable life just because one decided to be on their cell phone. As human beings everyone has important things on their cell phone like maybe an important call or even then an emergency, but nobody's life should be put in danger for something they did not do wrong. A lot of innocent people have had to be the victim in this situation. Before anyone even bothers to even start their car, it is important for them to take care of all their cell phone duty within that time period. If there is ever a moment that one may really need to use their cell phone it is better for them to pull themselves off to the side and take care of their problem because there is no need for this to become an innocent's person problem. Although this may sound like a broken record this is an ongoing problem that can easily be avoided.

"Phones and Driving

Should a person text and drive?

Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. I don't think you should always do it or always have to the need to use your phone while thing is happening around you. Imaging going 65 mph and your jus on the phone playing candy crush. What the chances of something wrong happening. A LOT

Driving is dangerous for those who don't really know a lot About it. You have to be sharp on the look about. What if a kid runs out to get his ball and you don't pay attention because you were on the phone? That would be devastating for your and the kid's family, having to act like you really wasn't on the phone lying that you didn't see him. All because they were on to phone and couldn't wait till, they were at a full stop to check it.

I think that's the only time you can check your phone, and I'm not talking about checking your whole social media accounts. I mean just making sure no one texted you or missed an important call. If you do pull in anywhere and check, if its that important you wouldn't put anyone else's life in danger. Its all safe or not safe at all and I don't care how long you've been driving anything can't happen to anyone. You can't de greedy and pick yourselves over a kid or young person who might have had something great happening.

Its never okay to check your phone while moving your vehicle. A lot of people lose their life's and others because there being irresponsible and just can't leave there phone alone. I hate driving and seeing someone texting like put it down before you run into me. Also, there are so many injury's and deaths because of it. There are almost 390,000 injury's each year and one out of fours car accidents are based on texting and driving.

Should a person text and drive? Really don't you think its all up to them because I don't. those are the reasons why I wouldn't want no one texting and driving its dangerous, and immature. I think everyone should just listen to the rules. Especially if you think about it, a law that could save your life or anyone else on the road. I think people shouldn't text and drive.",1
"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. People do a lot of things with cellphone, but they should never be able to use phones while driving a vehicle. There are many reasons why you shouldn't. Car crashes, running red lights, and death.

First is car crashes. Car crashes are very common, sometimes it can be because people don't know how to drive, but they are mostly caused because of people looking down at their phone instead of looking at the road. These are liabilities because you can really hurt someone or even take their life. Texting and social media are taking all of the attention away from you looking at the road. Why not be smart and just put the phone down for a few minuets and just relax and drive. It can save a life

Next is running red lights. Think about all of the things that can happen if you run a red light. A major ticket, a bad crash, and even a life. Just all of the bad things that can happen. Just putting the phone down can prevent all of the bad things that can happen to you and your loved ones. Say your driving on a major highway, maybe I-95, there is an intersection in the middle of the road and you need to see the red light because its about to turn. If your looking at your phone and miss the light you can cause a major disturbance in traffic.

Last is death, Think about how many people you can kill in a car crash. Your driving and you pick up your phone and miss a turn, you hit a car and that car hits 5 more cars and sets off a chain reaction, All of those people have a probability of dying because of how fast your going and how hard you hit them. Now you can be charged with murder and that gives you life in prison. So think about that about that before picking up your phone.

In conclusion all of these reason are why you should not be able to use your phone while driving.",1
"People do use their cell phones on a daily basis but they shouldn't use their phones when they are driving. When you are driving and texting you can cause a car crash or something worse. The only time you should have your phone while your driving is if you have a hands free mode. It is better to not text while driving you see some people like to text while they are driving so their not paying any attention to the road and to what's in front of them.

That will cause them to get into the following accidents: car crash, running someone over, or going off the road. These accidents have happened before including if there is a kid riding with you. It will also cause meager injures to the drive and the passengers even the kid. That is why we create cars that have a free hand mode so that way you call or text someone without looking at the phone. They even have phone holders that you can attach to the fane of your car.

For example I am a person who is always on my phone everyday. One day I am driving my kids to their friends house but then I get a text message from my friend. I pick up the phone and I read the text that means i'm paying more attention to my phone and not to the road. At that moment when I'm reapplying to his text suddenly a car pulls up and I try to slam on the brakes but then I crash into the car. I am very injured from the crash and my kids are also in pain that is what happens when you are texting and driving.

99% of people have gotten into this kind of accident all because they were texting and driving at the sametime. If we all didn't have are phones when we are driving we could avoid these accidents and be safe. Even Some people who are texting and driving can even cause death to a person because they got ran over by a car. Phones are a distraction when you are driving because it claimed up to 3,450 live back in 2016 alone and it still is. It also caused 391,000 injured people in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015.

Teens are the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes when texting. Back in 2013 about 1.2 million of car crashes have occurred all because of cell phones usage while driving statistics that had shown that this kind of behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Texting while driving statistics show that doing this behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. That is why when people are behind the wheel they shouldn't have there phone when driving.",1
"Since Alexander Graham Bell first patented the first practical telephone, the spreading of information has grown exponentially. The development of the telephone became something otherworldly. Today, people are able to communicate with each other at the tap of just one button. As amazing as that is, it has become an epidemic that people can't get themselves away from. More and more frequently the case of people getting into accident because of being on their cell phone while drive has been on the rise. This addiction has seemingly been the cause of many accidents that could have been avoided if people would have not been able to use their cell phones in any capacity while in control of a motor vehicle.

To begin with, cell phones and other electronics require attention from users that can't be given when operating a vehicle. Because of this, many people find themselves trying to split their attention between the phone and the road and typically end up giving more attention to the computer that they are able to hold in their hand. This lack of attention to the road causes accidents with other motorists which could have been avoided if there wasn't a phone in the way of the driver paying attention to the road. For this reason, people shouldn't even be able to use their devices in any such way while in the driver's seat of a vehicle.

Moreover, amny drivers have the mindset that their own personal driving isn't what they have to worry about--it's others. With a mindset like that, it begs the question of how that can be possible when motorists use their cellphones while driving. There is no way for anyone to be able to multitask so well that they can operate their vehicle, use their devices, and worry about others as they make it to their own destinations. Many may argue that they have the ability to do such things, but it has yet to be heard of someone multitasking at such a high caliber.

Finally, while drivers use their devices, there is simply no telling what might happen in the blink of an eye. Drivers need to be fully aware of the roads and what happening around their vehicles, so there can be not time or effort that can be put into using their electronics in any way while also driving. If someone were to lose the concentration that they have on the road, the possibility of an accident and casualties sharply increases.

In short, people should not have the ability to use their cellphones in any capacity while driving because the possibility of something tragic happen will sharply increase and the chance of someone surviving an accident because of cell phone usage will continue to drop.",1
"Phones and Driving

Should people be allowed to have a cell phone when driving is a no. I don't think that people should have one on them when driving. People already have a hard time staying off they phones without driving a car, they are already many cases of texting and driving, and lastly people who would be texting and driving would not just risk the lives of themselves but for other people as well.

People already have a hard time staying off they phones without being on the road. Any noise or vibration that they phones makes people stop everything just to look to see what's on they phone. While on the road, people should put they phones on silent mode to stop them from being distracted when driving. They are also other free apps that people can download to help stop them from looking at they phones.

They are many of police reports about people getting into bad/life threatening accident. It is a proven fact that 11 teens each day from texting and driving. It's also a proven fact that 9 out of 10 accidents on the road are caused by people not paying attention to the road. People that are on they phones when driving are not only putting they lives at risk, they are putting the other people on the road, people in the car with them, and also putting who are walking down the road also.

The people how would be texting and driving are not just risking their lives, they are also risking other people around them. When are not paying attention to the road and the people around them they tend to more accidents. They are many causes of people not paying attention when driving and then hitting somebody else's car.

That's why being on your phone when driving isn't safe for people who already have a phone problem, the people who have already had accidents when driving should have learned the first time, and lastly when driving and on a phone puts a lot of other peoples lives at risk.",1
"Do you believe that drivers should be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle?

""Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manages this dangerous risk."" Cell phone distraction rates are at an all-time high. At the same time, drivers were less likely to be seen holding a cellphone or talking on a hand-held phone than in the prior survey.

The problem of distracted driving, especially cellphone use, continues to raise concerns. Texting and driving also appears to be a problem, especially among younger drivers. It is easy to understand why using a hand-held phone is a problem. In addition to having your eye on the road, with one hand on the wheel it is harder to navigate bends and respond to hazards. If the level of difficulty on the road demands a certain amount of driver concentration, but the state of the conversation also requires a depth of thought, then both activities will compete for a bounds amount of cognitive resources.

The use of a cell phone should not be allowed while operating a vehicle, I say this because distractions while behind the wheel has caused so much trouble. ""True Motion tracks five levels of distraction: Non-call active usage (texting and app usage); non-call passive usage (hands-free app usage); phone call in-hand; phone call hands-free; and no distraction."" Naturalistic studies in the future may provide the means to document the patterns and circumstances of drivers' phone use and their effects on real-world driving. Currently, the best studies of crash risk used cell phone Company billing records to verify phone use by crash-involved drivers.

In conclusion, cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel. Do you believe that cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel? A number of jurisdictions in the United States and around the world have made it illegal for drivers to use hand-held phones. It appears that drivers' phone use will continue to increase, despite the growing evidence of the risk it creates. More effective countermeasures are needed but are not known at this time.",1
"Have you ever wondered why people text and drive? Texting and driving is dangerous and can cause trouble, not only for yourself but for other people. I think people should not be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

According to www. thezebra. com/texting-and-driving-statstics/ ""Use of a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in 2017"". This shows that 2 years ago a lot of people were using cellphones while driving .I feel as if the government could have a system where they can detect phones while people are driving , which means officers can look in drivers cars and doesn't have to be there physically. I think this idea will help people stay focused on the road more and can help other drivers stay safe.

I also think people should not be able to use a cellphone in capacity while operating a vehicle because if you are focused on your phone and your at a stop , you can hold up traffic and you can get a ticket for holding up traffic. According to www. google. com ""a traffic ticket is $70 to $400 depending on your state law and or drivers records'.If you have a bad driver's record and have unpaid tickets you will have to spend time in jail, pay fines, and your licences can get suspended.

I was doing some research about texting and driving and according to www. google. com 49% american adults admit to texting and driving, and 90% of american adults know texting and driving is dangerous. Some people know how to drive and the consequences behind texting and driving and there are still car accidents pertaining a cell phone. With the technology today , there are still accidents that could have been prevented and that were involved with a cellphone.

In other words i feel as if drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving because people can get into accidents and get harmed or possibly die from it. I also feel like if people are on their phone while driving it distracts them and they can hold up traffic and and get traffic tickets .Last but not least , people know they shouldn't text and drive and still do it . Society now and days know wrong from right but do the opposite .

My advice to people who text and drive ,is to stop texting and driving , if you need to use ur phone while on the road, make sure you have a passenger that can help with you.",1
"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.

So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.",1

Imagine if someone sends a text to a relative then they die because they were texting while driving. Texting while driving is a huge distraction can cause may accidents. A text is not more important than a life. Texting can wait once a person starts texting they are distracted from the road not only putting their own life at risk but others too. Texting and driving is bad it can ruin lives, its distracting, texting can also wait.

Texting distracts from the road when someone's focus is on something else it makes doing the task more difficult. Causing accidents that may result in the loss of life for the driver or anyone affected. Distracted driving is looked down upon by other cars. Other drivers know there could be an accident involving them if there is someone texting and driving that may result in thel lose money and time possibly loss of time.

Responding to a text while driving is not that important compared to the possible loss of life. This is why there are laws that prevent people from texting a driving which will result in a fin. Most people will probably choose living over texting because a human life is worth more than a response to someone's text. There are some people who have lost their life due to texting and driving. Now there familys are missing out of the time they could have spent with them if they were still living.

Texting can wait, yes you may have to respond to a text but it is more important than a life. Iphones are now coming with a feature to prevent people from texting and driving, for example if they do have there phone in there hand they have to agree that they are not texting and driving before opening the phone up. There is also a feature that will auto respond to text messages saying that the person is currently driving and can not respond. The last feature is that they would not receive the notification until there not driving, that makes it easier to forget about responding so not to be pressured.

Texting and driving is really bad and should not be done. Texting and driving is distracting and would cause you to have an accident. Responding to someone's text is not as important than someone's life. Finally responding to a text can wait and can be prevented because a life is worth more than a response to your friends and family. Laws are created for a reason texting and driving is no acception.",1
"Drivers should never be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving. Distracted driving is the number one cause for accidents and deaths. A hands free law should be placed all over the world. A driver behind the wheel distracted, is like a vehicle driving by itself. Distracted driving seems not to be a great problem to people. People think that driving under the influence is worst, which is not the case. There are many effects due to distracted driving.

Distracted driving is the number one problem that leads to many accidents. In many of those accidents, people die. "" In 2015, 37,461 lives were lost on US roads."" It's an increase of 5.6% from 2015. "" 10% of distracted driving led to crashes, 15% lead to injuries."" ""The NSC estimated that cell phone use accounted 27% of 2015 car crashes."" People that are driving districted is the same as if they were under the influence. When reading or sending a text message that takes your mind off the road for about five seconds, that's long enough to cover a football field while driving at 55mph. Cellphone users are 5% more times likely to get into an accident than a undistracted driver.

A worldwide law should be made for no cell phone use. Citizens should know longer be able to touch a phone when their driving. There should be no hands-free technology either. ""When finished making voice commands, drivers will stay distracted for up to 27 seconds. It takes 27 seconds for someone to get back into driving groove. Drivers might not notice signs, other vehicles, or pedestrians. According to the National Safety Council, almost 25% of car crashes involve cell phone conversations. Studies indicate that talking hands-free is more dangerous than drunk driving. Anything that can distract eyes, hands, or mind from the task of driving is considered a distraction. When someone is listening or speaking on a phone, their brain's ability to process moving objects decreases up to 1/3. Drivers should stay off mobile devices altogether, until there safely parked.

Cell phone capacity should never be put up to debate. No driver should be allowed to use their cell phone or hands-free technology. Hands-free technology is three times as much danger as having a phone in hand. Hands-free and distracted driving is worse than driving under the influence. Thanks to a distracted driver fatal accidents occur. Accidents go up about 6% every year. A worldwide law should be passed for no cell phone use while driving. Cell phone use should not be permitted under any circumstances.",1

Well what can I say about phones there are good for some but some use it for the bad. Like example people use it while driving that's bad because they should be looking at the road they shouldn't be on their phone for any reason useless they trying to call 911 for an energy other than that there is there is no reason to be on their phone. Also there are things to hold your phone for you so you won't have to get a ticket and have to pay for it when you can have something to hold your phone for you. When using it for the good you there is no reason to worry about there is always time to use your phone but while driving is never a good time just wait until you get to the place where you are going to there is always time you don't want to lose your life or someone life because you couldn't wait for a few minutes to get to the place you need to be at its always best to wait then to lose a live there is always time for anything but losing your life or someone else life Is not it.

"Phones & Driving

Communication has progressed from the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 to the endless communication that is now available in the 21st century, but it has come at a price. People's need for communication, specifically with cell-phones has created the serious issue of cell-phone use while driving. This issue leads to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving.

This issue has caused various accidents and sometimes deaths. The distraction that cell-phones create while driving has the ability to seriously injure or even take someone's life away. For many years, while most states have not had laws regulating cell-phone use while driving, there have been various PSA campaigns warning against cell-phone use while driving, usually specific with texting and driving. These PSAs are meant to scare drivers hoping that it will discourage this dangerous behavior.

These distracted drivers are usually texting to reply to someone, using their satellite navigation system on their phone, or could be adjusting their music through their phone. These behaviors have been specifically targeted by many states that have enacted laws to prevent cell-phone use that can cause accidents. Georgia, specifically, passed the hands-free rule, fining drivers for cell-phone use, holding the phone. This law can be easily obeyed because of the adjustments created by car companies and other accessories that are available. More recent cars have options for phones through the car to keep the driver focused on the road but keeping the communication possible for the driver. Cars may have an aux cord or a bluetooth option to be able to receive and make calls without touching the phone. Phones connected to the car this way, can play music through a cell-phone through the car, then the driver can control volume and choice of song through the steering wheel. There are many car accessories to make phone use safer like an attachment to the windshield that holds the driver's phone, to keep their eyes in the front to the road rather than to the side to look at their phone. These adjustments that coincide with laws like the hands-free rule allow drivers to safely use their cell-phones while driving.

This issue has lead to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving, but will continue to have serious consequences. While there are many solutions to this issue have been created it will still have consequences. People will continue to be injured or killed by this issue but without any restrictions or inventions this issue would not continued at the same rate. The precautions keep the roads as safe as they can be, because people will continue to use their cell-phones while driving, but at least it is more regulated and less distracting now.",1
"Essay

I think that using cell phones while driving is not the way to go because according to the law you can not drive,text at the same time simply due to the increase of crashing. Through out the recent years,more than half the populations drive and text which causes them to highly get into an accident. Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions to yourself therefore the accidents may increase rapidly throughout the years. I would prefer doing it when you're driving just because it is safer than driving. Operating a cell phones while driving can lead you to crash and will get you to a penalty for it. The safe way that I would say is to keep your cell phones off when you are driving because you'll get distracted to the cell phones once you pick it up.

The increase of the cell phone uses are very high simply to social media. Some say that there is no wrong in the doing of the cell phones use but I think that it causes many accidents and death rates to increase rapidly. The actions that many people take are actually risking their lives over a notifications on the phone and that will go horribly wrong to those whom use cell phones while driving. We have to follow certain laws from accidents and causing them. Everyday,there's at least some of the people such as young adults who text and drive all the time. Risking your life for something that doesn't have greater impact of your life is basically saying that cell phones are more important than paying attention to what the real world has.

During the years,many of the populations that causes theses accidents are young teens. Therefore,the death rate goes up throughout the years and some say that it's not the reason why. I feel like so many people look down into their phone then look up and see what's going on. For me driving and using cell phones is not the way to go for your life and for the safety,I would prefer you to always shut down your devices while driving so you don't get too distracted.",1
"In the United States, car wrecks because of distracted drive are increasing. The leading reason to distracted driving is cell phones. While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using the cellphone while driving, they even continue to take this risk. What would it take to make people to quit utilizing their cell phones while operating their car?

Cell phones have become a part of many people's daily lives, making it a struggle for them to sit the down long enough to drive and reach their destination. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cellphones in hand while behind the wheel. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the number one cause for vehicle accidents over the last two decades.

Using the phone while driving increases not only the driver, but the people around them chances of getting into an accident. In addition to it lessens the driver's awareness of their surroundings while on the road, causing more car accidents. ""Auto deaths have risen for two straight years, marking the biggest increase in more than dive decades. While lower gas prices have encouraged more driving, distracted driving due to cellphones has been tapped as one of the major causes. That has prompted many states to begin cracking down on phone use while driving with laws outlawing the behavior."" (Pressman, A..Apr.2017)

An increasing amount of states, prohibit the usage of cell phones while behind the wheel, exposing those drivers who break the laws to fines and additional punishments. What many drivers don't realize is that, not only could they receive fines for using their phone, but they could also be served with serious lawsuits if they cause an accident.

A large number of drivers do not believe that their driving performance is impacted by the usage of their cellphones. More than one half of drivers who speak on cell phones while driving feel as if their driving is no different from them being off the phone. This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving. This also shows why it's so important to have such strict rules and laws. ""Road safety appears to improve in states with laws that regulate driver's phone use. The states with the lowest amount of phone use while driving- Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington- have all banned the use of handheld devices behind the wheel.""(Johnson, D.Apr.2018)

To sum it up, the use of phones while driving has proven to be a huge safety hazard to drivers and those surrounding them. There should be laws in all states and even countries that ban the use of any device or distraction while driving in order to decrease the number of accidents on the road. It would also help people to practice using their phones less and become not so dependent on their phones.",1
"The Dangers of Using Cell phones While Driving

While some see that there is no problem with texting and driving, there is a law that says otherwise. Texting and driving are not safe for any age citizens. Texting is a distraction from focusing on the road while driving. There is no multitasking when it comes to texting and driving. There have been too many car accidents that have been caused by people using their phones while driving. To reduce the number of deaths due to texting and driving cell phones should not be permitted by drivers in any capacity.

Georgia's Hands-Free Law came into effect on July 1, 2018. ( ""Georgia Department Of Driver Services, "" 2018). This law states describes that it is illegal for drivers to hold their cell phones while driving. Drivers are allowed to use GPS, voice to text features, and receive and make calls hands free. Earphones are the best to use in this case; however, a person can only use one earpiece at a time. This law will help to reduce the number of many accidents caused by distracted drivers from cell phones.

In general, citizens should not use a cell phone while driving. Being on the phone while driving increases the risk of crashing. Even if you are stopped at a red traffic light, it is illegal and not safe. If there is an accident for texting and driving, there are penalties. The penalties are based on the first, second, and third offense. At each offense, there is a monetary fee and points taken off of your driver's license. If a driver has too many offenses, this could result in the suspension of an individual's license.

Unfortunately, there is one thing that people cannot multitask in, and that is texting and driving. When drivers text their attention is divided when it should be focused only on the road. Texting and driving is a dangerous thing because you can injure or kill someone else or even yourself. When driving you not only have to be focused on the road but also you have to be considerate of others on the road.

After all, texting and driving is against the law and just is not safe. No matter how young or old you are, you cannot focus on driving and texting without being at risk of having an accident. To protect your own life and others do not use your phone while driving. If you want to use your phone, you should wait until parked off the road. That way, you will not get any tickets, nor will anyone's life will be at risk.

"Phones have evolved exponentially, especially from the twentieth to the twenty-first century. Over the course of ten years, phones without cords have become commonplace. Many individuals use them while shopping, cooking, and exercising. There also use them while operating a vehicle. However, using any device while driving can cost thousands of dollars and even your life. Cellphones should not be used while operating a vehicle.

The term distracted driving has become prevalent in courtrooms because drivers are more susceptible to the accessibility cellular devices, streaming services, and social networks provide. According to the auto insurance comparison search engine, The Zebra, approximately nine people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured from car accidents when one driver is preoccupied with their cell phone. This means that defensive drivers are not impervious on the road when another driver utilizes a cellular device. We, as a society, have the responsibility to keep others safe. The next time one sees their loved ones should not be on an autopsy table following an easily preventable car accident. The solution is to this dilemma is to enforce laws pertaining to cell phone usage and operators of vehicles.

New drivers already face the challenge of utilizing their defensive driving in their daily lives. Many drivers, both new and experienced, would say that a notification on their phone takes a second to acknowledge. However, those who check messages risk their lives. According to Miller&Zois Limited Liabilities Company, a law firm based in Maryland, five seconds of viewing a text message is the amount of time it takes for car travelling at fifty-five miles per hour to drive across an entire football field. Therefore, if an individual decides to look at a notification or respond to a text message, that person could enter a river or cliff at that same speed by using a phone while driving.

Citizens are not entirely at fault. According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving is under-reported by law enforcement. This, in turn, means that too many offenders are only given warnings and no punishment for their reckless behavior. Tax-paying civilians are suffering because authorities do not hold offenders accountable for dangerous driving habits. Every state must outlaw phone use and produce punishments for those who continue to indulge in their distraction on the road, lest they seek for a steady increase in distracted driving injuries and fatalities.

Humans are said to be social creatures. However, social behaviors will limit the focus of drivers. A single second is an ample amount of time to lose one's life. Phones and driving are as compatible as water and oil. Do not post a picture, send a text message, read a book, or watch a movie when behind the wheel. Put the phone out of sight and out of reach.

"I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because it causes many car crashes every year, it can make your car insurance go up even higher, and if you have a passenger in the car you should also think about their lives as well. People are more worried about who they're texting or who they're on the phone with. Driving while on the phone shouldn't be taken lightly because you are endangering your life and others around you. In this essay I will give you reasons why texting on the phone should be banned.

The first reason is that you can easily cause an accident while you're on the road. If you use a phone while driving it's basically like you're driving while drunk because you're not focused on the road as much as you think. ""Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving"". If you are texting while driving you're going to be more focused about sending that text to your friends or family than driving. ""One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving"". That is the first reason why you shouldn't text and drive.

Another reason while texting while driving should be banned is because it can cause your insurance to go up. If you get in a car accident because you were texting instead of focusing on the road is bad because your insurance company will find out and they will raise your car insurance because of that. ""The more tickets you attract to your name because of driving while on the phone the more your insurance bill goes up"". If you cause an accident because you were on your phone then the bill to get there car fixed has to be paid by your insurance company. ""It states that the person that is at fault for a car accident caused by cell phone use their insurance company has to pay for the damage"". That is my second reason to why cell phones should be banned while driving.

My last reason why cell phones should be banned is because they could hurt or even kill passengers or pedestrians. Transporting other people in your vehicle is a big responsibility especially if you tend to use your phone will driving. ""Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, even though some young drivers fail to notice"". If you use your phone to send a text while driving with passengers in the car you are putting their lives in danger as well as other pedestrians. Most people probably couldn't live with the guilt knowing they caused someone to suffer a life altering injury or even death. ""Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle"".

That is the last reason why I chose to ban cell phone use while driving.

Laws banning texting and driving should be mandatory in each state. Many people do not realize that texting while driving can be just as dangerous as driving drunk. People should always be focused on the road then texting someone while driving especially if you just started driving. Those are my three reasons why cell phone use should be banned while driving.

"Cellphones & Driving

More and more people are finding access to cell phones as technology develops and becomes more inexpensive. Cars are starting to become more technologically advanced as well. With the ever evolving future of technology people are making questionable choices such as time and place of use. More and more people have began using their electronic devices as they drive putting not only themselves but the lives of others in danger. Cellphones should not be used while operating machinery such as a car or truck or SUV.

Behind the wheel is no place of use for cellphones. You're putting yourself in severe jeopardy of being hurt or killed. When driving you should always have your attention on the road as to avoid any bad situation or at least help prevent one. Cell phones distract you from this goal and may cause you to get side tracked. Without the use of phones behind the wheel there's less likely a chance that you will get into a wreck.

A lot of cars are becoming more technologically advanced as science progresses. We now have self driving cars which can keep the driver hands free. These self driving cars may still have trouble reacting to split second decisions in which May cause you harm. Even if you don't have to drive yourself you should still be focused on the road. A cell phone may be more appropriate in this situation given that you're not the one driving the car at the time however to ensure safety do not use your phone until the vehicle is safely parked and there is no risk of a wreck.

Bluetooth technology has been changing the way we use electronic devices for years. With this there is no reason to constantly be in use of your phone when the Bluetooth streams the audio directly from the device to your cats radio. People have created mount devices for phone in cars to help keep you off them more but still do miniscule tasks that you may deem necessary. Many people put their phone in the back seat just to keep it out of arms reach and dampen the temptation of usage.

Ultimately cellphones in cars are a bad idea. Drivers still need to pay attention to the road rather than to a device that's endangering their lives. Despite all of the advances in technology there's not a single one which ensures complete safety. The use of Bluetooth and other strategies to help limit cellphone usage may help if a drive is in need of a prevention plan for cell phone usage while driving. Don't endanger yourself or others by not operating a motorized vehicle with a cellphone in use.",1

Phones are used for communication and benefit our lifestyle, but they have also become a major issue while driving. Although, many people know that there are severe consequences to being a distracted driver, they still do it. Driving is a big responsibility and it should be taking very serious. Texting is the main reason as to why people check their phones in the first place, and it keeps getting worse.

Many companies and programs have encouraged people to drive as safe as possible. Many fail to perceive that teens are the largest group involved in car accidents.

The consequences of texting and driving can be fatal. Many believe that texting and driving isn't a big problem and that they are able to handle multitasking. According to Snyder and Associates, atleast 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phone while being behind the wheel. It is very tempting to answer a text or a call while driving, but you should be aware of all the safety risks that come with making that decision. Most states have passed laws to make texting and driving illegal. Although most of the US has made an effort to persuade people to drive safely and avoid texting while driving, The National Safety Council reported that approximately 1.6 million car crashes are due to the use of cell phones. Lives of many are lost prematurely because of drivers who make the wrong decision and choose to text and drive. How many more lives have to be lost in order for people to understand that a text can wait?

Teenagers are the main and largest group that are implicated in consequential car accidents. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, distractions are one of the main ""critical errors"" that lead to teens crashing. Teenagers who are new to driving don't have as much knowledge as an experienced driver. Taking their eyes off the road and checking their phones is a common and dangerous mistake that many make. Most adolescents know the consequences of being distracted while driving. As reported by Edgar Snyder and Associates, 56% of teen drivers admit to talking on the phone while driving, and 13% admitted to texting and driving. Being behind the wheel is a big responsibility. The driver not only has to think about being safe they have to think about avoiding any fatal injuries to themselves and/or others.

No state completely bans the use of cell phones for everyone completely. According to

Governors Highway Safety Association, 38 states ban the use of cell phones for teen drivers, and 21 states as well as D.C. prohibit cell phone use for bus drivers completely. Utilizing phones behind the wheel has serious a serious outcome. Premature death is one of the many results of drivers being distracted. There are consequences for those who break any type of law, and breaking driving laws is not an exception. Traffic citations, fines, loss of license, and/or jail are a few of the many consequences. Fines and jail time may increase if the incident keeps happening, if the driver is drunk, or if the driver or any other passenger is injured.

The person behind the wheel is accountable for getting to places safe. Driving is a big responsibility and should be taken extremely serious. Drivers need to understand that to get to a destination it is a must for you to follow the safety rules. Distracting driving is something that can be changed. There is no need for people to die and their families to suffer, because a person is driving carelessly. Be responsible.",1

"In The United States of America and throughout the whole world the usage of cars has been in existence for so many years. Humans use this vehicle to get from one place to another in a easier way. Cars have not always been a safe spot to be in. Many human beings have lost their lives because of a car accident. Technology and social media has had a big growth throughout the years and it has played a major part in car accidents. Phones should not be used while driving.

The first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you have a higher chance of getting in a car accident. Getting in a car accident is bad because you are able to lose your life or even worse, killing someone else. If you were to die in a car accident you would definitely leave your family destroyed. Imagine your mother and father having to bury you instead of the opposite way around. It's most likely that you will always live with the fault that you killed someone else. Putting the phone on the side and on do not disturb is something so easy to do than can benefit you in the long run.

The second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you can get yourself a ticket. You might not think that it's a big deal but it really is. A ticket can cost you a lot of money and sometimes trouble. A ticket can cost you more than what you would pay for your phone bill. Having a ticket means having a bad record. For any reason when you want to get a new job, They will be able to tell that you aren't a responsible driver and even worse not a responsible person. It's better to have a good record than to not have one and not be able to get the job you want.

The third reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because phones can be put on do not disturb. When your phone is on do not disturb you are not capable of receiving calls, text messages, and notifications from any of your social media accounts. You have to be able to control your brain and body. Your phone is not a need, It's not something you have to be holding every second/minute. Allowing your phone to be on do not disturb is allowing you to live a longer life and prevent a tragedy like a car accident. It's better to think soon than regretting it later when it's too late.

A phone should not be allowed to be used while driving because you can kill yourself or kill someone else, you can get yourself a ticket, and phones can be put on do not disturb. It's nothing new to watch the news and see that there's another victim of a car accident due to phones. People have to think better and make smart decisions on the road. Once you have your hands on the wheel you shouldn't take your eyes off the road. Accidents due to being on your phone can cause you stress in life and also capable of having bad memories. Prevent is better than to regret and that will be the smartest quote to remember in life. Keep your eyes on the road and don't let a phone distract you.",1

On the contrary phones may be a distraction when a driver is behind the wheel. When someone is driving they should be aware of their surroundings at that point in time.

Reasonably, people need to set their phones aside while they are operating a vehicle. The chances of an accident are increased when the driver has a phone in hand.

Once you realize you may crash the vehicle when you look up from your phone it is often too late. If a driver puts their phone down when they are behind the wheel, they will be more attentive. An aware driver has a significantly lower chance of an accident in comparison to an unaware driver.

Phones and driving has been a big issue in the past and there have been many arguments on should we have phones while driving.

There have been many car crashes and 70% of them are teens on their cell phones. Adults are also on their phone while on the road. There are a lot of lives being took In fatal car accidents, cars are not anything to be played with you only get one life. It was a law passed that you can't talk while driving but that's not the case because you can always use speaker phone.

In 2018 there was a law passed that the driver can't have a cellphone in his or her hand while driving but that law was senseless because of speakerphone. Phones can be very destracing while drivng because of people texting you and replying back to a message. It should be an outstanding ticket for those who are caught texting while driving. In 2016 there were 365 people killed in Georgia that means every day at least one person was killed that year. It has to be an end to these fatal car accidents.

I think there should be a law passed in every state that phones shouldn't be picked up in a vehicle by the driver at all unless of emergency. It's only fair to the community that a no cell phone policy should be passed because innocent citizens are dying. Car accidents are not just tied around phones because most accidents are people under the influence of drugs or alcohol in the United Sates. Eliminating cell phones would be just reduce accidents and keeping family and friends safe. Nobody wants to loose their life in a car from someone texting and not paying attention to the road.

Phones are mainly for entertainment purposes, when you are on the road you have to keep your eyes up and stay focused. When you are getting your driving license you should have to sign a paper saying you won't use your cellphone while on the road or you will be fined and loss of driving privileges. There has been to many people took from their family behind a car. Cars are more dangerous from the looks and airbags don't always save you. Often times the airbags hurt you.

In the future I wish to see a new law passed regarding cellphones while on the road. I feel like if they pass that new law the % of car accidents will reduce. It's going to be that one person to save our following citizens , and pass that law to help us as a whole. If this law do pass it will be a significant change in the deaths per year. Cellphones should be banned while on the road because the high death rate.

"Driving in itself is a dangerous thing, and using your cell phone while doing so puts you at a even higher risk of having an accident. I bet you didn't know that 26 percent of accidents are caused by people who were using their cell phones while driving. Here are some reasons talking about how using your cell phone should not be allowed while you are driving.

The first topic discussing how using your cell phone while driving is dangerous, is swerving.

Let's say you're driving and your buddy texts you, and you pick your phone up to answer the text, While you were texting your friend back you got distracted and swerved into another lane. It doesn't matter if it took you two seconds or two minuets to text something back; the point is your focus wasn't on the road, and because of that you are now in another lane. One example of this is actually one that happened to my family and I while we were on a trip. The car in front of us kept going off the side of the road, and kept swerving in between the two lanes. When we finally got over and got around him, we saw where he was distracted by his phone. When you get distracted and start swerving, you are putting the people around you in danger, which is my next topic.

When you are driving and you are paying attention to your phone rather than the road, you are putting the people around you in danger. An example of this would be something like; say you're driving, and there is a wreak ahead and the car in front of you stops. However you had no idea that they had stopped because you were too busy looking at your phone. Say you don't stop in time and you hit them. Or say you slam on your breaks at the last second so the person behind you, hits you. What if you can't stop in time so you have to swerve over. In any of these situations you have put someone else, and yourself in danger. Plus on top of that you could have caused an accident. That takes us along to my next topic, accidents.

Accident can happen anywhere at anytime, and can be caused by anyone doing anything. But like I said before 26 percent of accident are caused by drivers on their phones. I'm sure everyone has heard their own story about an accident that has happened because someone was on their phone. However one that really just sticks out to me is one my family and I saw the aftermath of. We were driving up to Atlants on weekend. There wasn't much traffic on either side of the interstate, it just looked as it usually does with Atlanta traffic starting to kick in. A little further down the interstate on the other side there was a ton of traffic. We looked as we went by all the fire trucks and police cars, and there was an 18-wheeler and a smaller car. The smaller car was up under the front of the 18-wheeler. Later that night my parents had the news on and it said that the driver of the 18-wheeler was on their phone and had gotten distracted. They wern't paying attention to the road or what was in front of them and somehow ran over the other smaller car.

Twenty-six percent of accidents are caused by distracted drivers on their phones. Being distracted by your phone while driving can cause swerving, putting others in danger, and accidents. If you are swerving while you're driving, you are putting the people around you in danger, and that could lead to an accident. This is why I do not believe cell phones should be allowed while driving. So next time that you're behind the wheel, think before you pick up your phone. You don't want to be part of that 26 percent because you couldn't wait to open your friends Snapchat.",1
"Over the years cell phones have become a very useful tool .The demand of using a phone has risen in today's society . But should we be able to use our cell phones while being on the road? The number of people that have used their phones on the roads and highways have increased so much . Some people don't understand how important it is to be completely focused on the road and for the people in their car and everyone near them. Should we leave a message unread or not answer a call or answer the text or call but be at risk of causing the life of someone ?

People tend to always want to be on their phones and be in touch with other people during social media, call, or text , despite the danger of causing an accident. We keep our phones closer than our loved ones. Phones are a constant distraction such as meetings, movies ,meals and especially when we are driving. Everyday people die from car accidents because someone was using their phone while driving . Studies have shown that there is a 4% greater risk of drivers being in a car accident due to using a cell phone. Overall the crashes every year because of cell phones are 1.6 millions with 330,000 million injured in them.

Hands free devices can also be harmful . You are focused on the road but if something happens to your phone for example the call ended or you received a message then you are distracted and want to grab your phone . A lot of people would think that probably if I just take one second to look at my phone nothing will happen. But that's not true a car accident can happen based on the driver not looking on the road . You can't multitask when you are driving ! If you would like to be a safe driver you would have to make sure you process a ton of information about your environment and surroundings at all times.

Georgia's new hands free cell phone law has resulted in more than 1,000 tickets since the start of the law . Georgia's residents aren't allowed to have their phone in their hand or part of their body . They are only allowed to use if it's on a wireless headphones, speaker or bluetooth . Their first fine is $50 , second is $100, and third is $150 and a subsequent conviction . Georgia has become the 16th state that enacted a hands free driving law. Georgia would like for residents to stop using their devices when driving because cell phones only continue to increase the number of accidents.

It's a privilege to be able to drive and we shouldn't just think about ourselves but about the people we are risking when we are driving. Cell phones are a very important tool in our life but we should know when it's not the right time to use it. It's better to leave the phone down and ignore the missed calls and texts then not being able to get to our destination and being with our loved ones because we couldn't leave our phone down. Put it down and just drive !",1

Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash.

Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. But there a good system call ""handsfree"" an adjective describing equipment that can be used without the use of hands (for example via voice commands). That's a safe way to call someone without touching or seeing the phone. Overall, It may be said that texting while driving is bad and maybe just put your phone on Do Not disturb mode.",1
"Phones and Driving

The usage of cell phones instantly grew after the introduction in the 1980s. One of the primary reasons they have grown in popularity is cell phones allow people to communicate from all over in a matter of seconds. Due to the fact cell phones are such a vital part of lives, phone use while driving has become a definite safety concern. Adults spend an average of 45 minutes a dav on social media. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted 1,830 motor vehicle accident fatalities for young drivers, according to teendriversource. org. Many of the accidents were from distracted cell phone use. Cell phones should not be used in any capacity while operating a car for fear of distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities.

Cell phones being such an essential item in today's society, people find it hard to let go of cell phones while diving. Phone holders and Wifi have been added to many vehicles to enable hands free cell phone use while driving. Participating in any activity while driving, other than watching the road and their surroundings, creates distractions. Texdng, calling, reading tex ts, or sin1ply holding a phone to your ear can cause a momentary attention distraction. In a split second these distractions can cause a major accident. Phone usage is so dangerous because drivers are distracted with manual operation, visual reading, and cognitive processing (Bonner).

Accidents are financially costly to all parties involved. Car insurance can double when accidents are caused by phone usage. For drivers at fault in accidents, rates increased more than

$500 (Moore). The number of accidents determine car insurance rates for the area. With more accidents due to cell phones, rates have increased overall. All drivers are paying in some way for the irresponsibility of distracted drivers. Many states have passed laws to prohibit cell phone use while operating a car.

Using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S roads. In the U.S., inappropriate phone use caused over one million car accidents (Edgar Snyder, n. a). Teen accidents with motor vehicle crashes involving fatalities were a result of distracted driving. When answering a text while driving, it takes your attention away for about five seconds. A great deal of things can happen in five seconds. Overcorrecting the car while on the phone has unfortunately been the cause of many fatalities. No conversation is worth human life

It goes without saying that cell phone use in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and threatens safety. Statistics support the reasoning for restriction of use while operating a motor vehicle. Distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities prove why cell phone use should be forbidden.

"Cell Phone usage in cars

Do you ever catch yourself being on your phone more than you should be while driving down the road? In today's world we have had to put a lot of laws and regulations in place just to keep people safe. For example Georgia's hands-free law took effect July 1, 2018 with all new rules and regulations about cell phones being used while driving.

In my opinion parts of the law makes things safer but then some of it is a little too much. One thing that I agree with is that ""Even with hands-free technology, drivers cannot write, read, or send text messages, emails, social media content and other internet data while on the road."" I feel very strongly about this one due to there being so many people who have accidents while trying to send texts or look at the latest posts while at a traffic stop. Some parts are a little too much though, starting with ""Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while driving. ""It would be crazy to get a ticket just for your phone touching you.

Phone usage in vehicles has its pros and cons. I think it's great to have a cell phone with you at all times any time you get in a vehicle to drive in case of an emergency. Also Cell phone usage usually causes emergencies. I believe drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle, but only hands free. Also they need to make the vehicles more acquitted to ensure cell phones can only do certain things in it.

For example care could not allow any texts to be sent or received. You also shouldn't be able to make hands free cells when going certain speeds. I also think they should bult in systems for teenage drivers where it sends notifications to the parents when they go over the speed limit, break hard or drive without a seat belt.

In conclusion I feel that cell phone usage in vehicles should be allowed. They create a lot of accidents but they also save lives by calling for help. Cell phones are a lot of people's lifelines. And should be allowed usage in cars!

"Put Phones Down While Driving

Everyday there are people dying or in an accidents because they are using cellphones while driving.

Some causes of accidents/crashes while driving on the phone is voice calling, playing videos games, looking in the camera, trying to answer a phone call, or trying to check a message. It is hypothesized that despite an effective way of communication, using cellphones during driving results in distracting attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

Cell phones while driving is one of the biggest issues in today's society. People are using their cellphones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, or being on social media. Sometimes we can do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are using their cellphones while they are driving. We have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others and ourselves because we cannot put the phone down.

Using cellphone while driving is not a good idea because it can hurt others/yourself, the roads, rise your insurance, or even have to come out your pocket to pay for the damage you have created to someone else car.

Texting while driving and otter cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threating norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phones use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while distracted, including the use of mobile device while driving, resulting in injury and loss of life .

Therefore, if you have an emergency you may use a cell phone to dial 911 o you can also pull over. When you have an emergency you have the right to dial the police if something is not right.

In my opinion people use that right to get on social media, check messages, or call someone instead of just continue to drive and keep their eyes on the road.

In my opinion you should not use cell phones while driving because it can cause crashes, death, or even hurt the road.

If it's not an emergency you should not be able to use your mobile device.",1
"Current day, almost everyone owns a cell phone. When using a cell phone, you are easily distracted. For instance, say you are on vacation and you were looking for a restaurant on your phone and fell in the water. But, if you're easily distracted while walking, imagine how much more distracting you'd be in a car. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.

When you're driving, you not only have to be aware of yourself, but your surroundings. Including construction, other drivers, and pedestrians. Already as a driver it's hard to stay focused when you have passengers and/or playing music. Now picture you're driving down the road and see a man on his phone hit a kid on a bike and speed off afterwards. There are many safety hazards while driving and adding a phone into the equation, only adds more. Georgia has just now recently added the ""Hands Free"" rule to where it's illegal to be on your phone as you're driving. There are over 1.5 million car crashes a year caused from phones and over 385,000 injuries a year. So, the no phone rule is very a good addition and one of the best laws I've ever heard of.

On the other hand, some people argue that it shouldn't be a rule. They give pointless points like GPS, or ""Important Phone Calls"". There are easy fixes to these. If you are worried about getting an important call, connect your phone to your Bluetooth on your car. If your car doesn't have Bluetooth, whenever someone calls, you could just put it on speaker. For the GPS part, all you have to do it get a device that'll hold your phone for you. It allows you to see any calls, messages, or the GPS. There are many fixes for why not to have this law, but no good reason on why it shouldn't be a law.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to hold their phone personally in their hand while driving. If that means zero access in some places, then so be it. It's not worth someone losing their life because you wanted to text someone back or talk to your significant other. But, if have a device that holds it for you is allowed, that they be a win-win for everyone. There's a right time for your phone, the car is not one.",1
"Driving and cell phones are like water and oil they do not mix. The generations of today does not understand that when it comes to texting while driving, it is a highly dangerous thing that turns into a horrible habit. Yet it still persists to be a problem. They do not see the danger, the risk of punishment, and the effect it can have on their normal lives.

Many cannot see the consequences driving and texting can bring to their lives and the life changing effects if others are affected.

First of all, the dangers of this habit is that people have started to make are hugely deadly to everyone who participates in it. Texting while driving has an equal to more deadly affect on you as drinking and driving. The main reason is that it is a distraction, when a person checks their phone or device they take their eyes off the road.

This can cause massive accidents and deaths across the entirety of the united states. Our new generation is at greater risk, most times it is within the youth that is the age of twenty and below causing car insurance to become more expensive for the youth.

Secondly, if a person is caught they are subjected to a ticket, first offense for 50 dollars and second offense 100 dollars including points on their drivers licenses depending on the state.

A person can not get jail time for texting and driving, but can be sent to jail if texting while driving is what caused an individual to crash and kill a person. Most times however people will sue for the damages caused to them and their personal vehicle. These are the possible ways that people can get in trouble for texting and driving.

Lastly, the effect it can have on a person's life can be very drastic. As I mentioned with the ticket one can receive it will most times raise the prices of the insurance provider that the person may have and cause an increase in price. Another effect that it can have on a person's life is jail time, which on its own is bad as it takes away some rights like the inability to vote, own a firearm, or sometimes get a job. Due to one decision, it can change a person's life forever, especially if their actions take away a life. That is some examples of major ways this can affect a person's life.

Thus I end with the evident conclusion that the entirety of the texting while driving problem is exactly as I stated a problem that must be dealt with. The portable devices and dangerous habits need to end on account that it kills thousands on the roads every year. With the laws and regulations in place along with the law enforcement watching this problem should clean itself out. The problems of the danger involved, the risk of punishment and impact on regular life should make all people reconsider before picking up the phone while on the open road.",1
"Having a phone while driving is a very dangerous thing, which is why no one should ever do it.

Driving with any type of device can cause serious injury or even death.

If more of a risk was added to using a phone while driving then people would not do it.

It should be against road rules to use a phone, if anyone breaks this rule they should be punished.

One reason that drivers should not use a phone while driving is, if they have children in the car.

If a parent uses a phone while having children in the car can cause the parent and the children to become hurt.

There were 416,000 injuries from people using phones in 2020 alone.

This shows why using a phone while driving with kids in the car.

Kids may also grow to do the same thing if they see their parents doing it.

When that happens then all kids will be putting their life in danger.

To solve this Parents should be watched in order to prevent putting their children in harm's way.

This will ensure that all children will be safe In the future.

Next, is that the health of other drivers are in stake. Most safe drivers die or become injured from other drivers that are not paying attention.

There are people who actually follow the rules of the road that die from other drivers. When other drivers are doing what they are supposed to do but another driver isn't then both their likes are at stake. Not every driver breaks the rules, a lot of ppl like to keep themselves safe and keep others safe.

Finally new drivers will be affected by this as well. Newer drivers might be scared to get on the road bc of other drivers.

Most young drivers use their phone while driving as well. Teens today are all about technology which causes them to use their phone while driving. Tere should be more of a penalty if you use a phone while driving. It will slow down how many people get into car related accidents. With this in place then everyone will be so much safer while driving.

This is why no one should drive with a phone. It kills people and affects their lives. Something should happen if someone is caught with a phone while driving. Teens should be taught not to use phones when they are learning to drive.",1
"Phones and driving

Do you believe texting and drive is bad and can cause car accidents or any terrible thing to happen? Honestly doing any like that can lead to no common sense especially when you have someone in the car with you. Over thousands of people die from a car accident situation which unlikely happy for love one's. I feel like more of this comes from young adults and teens because there still in that developing stage where this and that needs to be learned. Even though, car accidents happen you shouldn't be scared to drive or stop you from driving.

You should just be a lot safer than other with driving. But, if you happen to get a crash and it manage to be your fault you shouldn't take it all into that one mistake to.

There are a lot of things you need to realize with driving and texting. First of all if you do it you need to be cautious and smart about it. Because one if you need to text someone because it's an emergency do it at a red light or if you need to tell someone important then just stop somewhere . If you don't do none of the sort you can lead to accident or dealing with the cops. And, you can get in a lot of trouble with dealing with the cops. If you feel like driving and texting is ok then maybe it is to you only if you know what your doing and being safe with those actions. The statistics are very high for teens almost 11 die everyday texting and over 80% of people own cell phones.

Some people would say is sending that 1 small text important that causing your life or that other person life. Is it worth it because bad things happen everyday even if we don't want them too. Also , you can pull a ride with anyone and if there on the phone and you feel unsafe let them know that but if your scared you risking everything cause you never know what's gonna happen. The only thing you can really do is pray for the best to happen and keep living your life. I feel like every driver should be at least 17+ driving because at the age i feel like a little more common sense it should know by now what the rules are.

In, conclusion we know that texting and driving both don't get along or work out for people at the end of the day. Teens are the main people who get distracted because either there texting or playing with there friends in the car which seems to be a very bad idea knowing they are so very young. People always make excuses as soon as an accident happens with them. They try to say they were getting something that fell or telling one of there passengers in the back to stop knowing all they have to say is i was texting.

I feel like we should have this thing in the future where we get in the car our phones automatically turn off so then there would be no problem with anything. I say this because it's better than doing that one stupid thing then risking however many lives are in thart car.

"Drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Cell phones are simply too distracting even for the most talented enough most experienced driver enough to drive and chew gum. I feel like Unless Bluetooth is built into the car and designed to operate as a vehicle accessory much like a radio or windshield washer control I done see a problem with being on the phone while driving because it is hands free.

But we are being our own worst enemies when it comes to driving while on the phone it is Hard to that everyone knows at least one accident caused by using a cell phone while driving even if you can walk and chew gum at the same time, gum chewing is an unconscious activity. Talking on a phone and driving are not. People who think they are as alert talking on a cell phone and driving are probably the same people who think one, two or three drinks doesn't dumb down their driving skills.

I follow many drivers, of all ages, who start slowing down considerably or start swerving in traffic and there are not even young like me they are older people that could be the age of my parents that are driving reckless while on the phone like when they are looking for their phones to answer them, to call someone, or to text someone. This causes braking from everyone else that causes unnecessary crashes from everyone else. Cell phone use and driving is a distraction no matter who is doing it. I it doesn't matter how many years' experience that person has driving. You are not going to drive a car while talking on a cell phone in drivers ed, so why do it on the road with real citizens not cones? Next time you're talking on a cell phone and driving, once you hang up, try remembering how many stop lights you just went thru.",1
"Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all behind a wheel. Today's technology has become a big impact on everyone life. The most used technology of them all is the cell phone. This device has any and everyone hypnotized which makes it very dangerous. Cellphones is a deadly device to me personally because people that on our cellphones do not pay attention to what goes on around them. That's why it's important for us to not have them while driving.

Studies have shown that at least 6% of accidents have been caused by somebody using a cellphone. It seems that not only are drinking and driving dangerous, but using a cellphone behind the wheel is very dangerous. People in this generation believe that it's always dangerous if you text and drive. Just being on your phone period can be a dangerous situation for anybody, not just you. People believe that since you are not texting on the phone that it should be okay to be on the phone, I believe you shouldn't be on it period!

If we put our phones up and pay attention, a lot of accidents could prevent. We could have saved many lives. Cellphones are a huge distraction believe it or not, especially in today's society. It seems that the cellphone has become everyone's priority. That's why we cannot put them down for more than five minutes. Even talking on your phone is worse than texting, but texting is what people talk about the most. We should be talking about people being on their phones period .Just being on your phone can be more dangerous than anything.

See, driving a vehicle is already dangerous enough because you can easily end your or someone else's life. You need all of your attention on the road and what's going on around, so you can be aware. A cellphone will take your attention away from most of things around you. Texting while driving can take away from reaction time. If you're on your phone, it will give less time to react to a situation.

In conclusion, I believe drivers should not be allowed to drive while they are on a cellphone.

Cellphone are a huge distraction and with this distraction people can be injured or killed from using their phone. Instead of talking about texting while driving we should talk about us not using a cellular device at all when you're behind a wheel. We should try to enforce it more so people's lives can be save, and people don't have to get injured.",1
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives.

People use their cell phones for just about everything like texting, calling and finding anything they need to know. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving. Using cell phones while driving is dangerous to the driver for a couple of good reasons. It is very distracting because if your focusing on your phone your not looking at the road. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing.

It is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. Cell phones support in making a direct contact with person effectiveness while driving. Using a cell phone while driving is dangerous and not advisable, it provides the convenience of tackling emergency situations , listening to music through hands-free, and tracking routes.

Driving while using a cell phone or drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. If you get a ticket or accident you insurance will raise.",1
"Nowadays it have been many car accidents and deaths due to driving while distracted. The main distraction is your own phone. and to me I think this should completely changed around and make it to the point where they should take away when driving. I will talking on why I think the people should stop driving and using they phone.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable,

It turns out that cellphone-use-while-driving laws vary depending on the state that you're in. If you're on a road trip across state lines, troopers might be able to pull you over for something that may be perfectly legal in your home state. You should also be aware of how distracted the other drivers around you might be.

So as you see all the facts of you shouldn't have your phone while driving have just been justified. Knowing that not only your life is in danger the next person life's in danger. And hop that this can spark a new beginning of getting driving while distracted ban.",1
"Phones and Driving

Everyday people die in car accident, but most of those accidents are caused by people on their cell phones. This here is one of the biggest issues the world faces every day with drivers getting their self's in danger and others over a phone call or text message. If you think the slight chance that any of this isn't important and the world is just making a big deal about this, will then let me give a hand and give you a lesson. In 2011s Cell Phone and Driving Statistics, it's estimated that 23% of all car accidents each year are cause by cell phones use. That's 1.3 million crashes and 10 % of those car crashes have been fatal to many others.

Cause of these accidents many are wondering if people should or should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. If we were to have a week that no one could use their phones for while driving that long the amount of car crashes and accidents could possible or will decrease by the hundreds. Know yes there still will be car crash happening but not by phones anymore, but we really can't do that cause some people aren't going to give up their phones while driving. But there is a better option one that's already being put in place in many states and counties and that laws. Yes, laws are already being test or being placed in many states banning phones while driving now, but they all have a different way of solving this problem. In some states the law only effects teens under 18 or 21 from using their phones when driving hoping to dramatically decrease the chance of car accidents where in other states they don't allow ant one to use their phones at all, for example California has a law that any one 18 or above are ban for using their phones on the roads or anywhere while their using a car, same goes for Hawaii as well. With these laws we can finally decrease the number of crashes, want some proof? In 2017 the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that highway fatality numbers are going down for two consecutive years, it even led in to the first six months of 2018. If we keep it up, we could have much saver highways and neighborhoods for the kids to play in.",1
Drivers should not be able to be on the phone while driving because that causes accidents and while they are on there phone they are not looking at the rode. If your not looking at the rode how are you going to see what's going on you wouldn't be able to see what the cars are doing in front of you. If you are on the phone and you come across a stop sign you wouldn't be able to see and you keep going and you get hit by a car because you didn't have the right away that accident would be your fault because you were on your phone and you wasn't paying attention to the rode you could be on your phone at a red light and the light turns green and your still sitting there because your on your phone. Being on your phone can cause the police to pull you over and give you a big ticket price or worse take you to jail depending on what you did. The hole point is being on your phone while driving causes to many problems so the best thing to do is keep your phone in your pocket while you are driving. Because if you don't you will have a car accident research says that most car accidents that happen the people that caused the accident were on there phone your phone or text message can not be that important to the point were your risking your whole life.,1
"Technology and Driving

Have you ever been riding in the car and looked over at a red light and saw someone on their phone? I see it all the time when I go places with my parents, though we know it is illegal today in GA and other state people still do it. Driving is an activity that requires all your attention. My mom would always you are not only driving for yourself but for everyone on the road. No one should be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle to ensure safety for all drivers and even pedestrians.

Being a driver means you are responsible for your life and others driving and existing around you. Unfortunately, driving accident statistics gathered by edgarsnyder. com says, 1out of every 4 accidents in the US is caused by phone use while driving. That is a large portion of accidents and if we cannot use our phones while driving to rid a quarter of accidents then its worth it. The countless amounts of stories about parents and friends losing loved ones to accidents is an untimely loss that can never be justified, and we should do everything we can to spare people from a hurt such as that.

Outside of accidents leading to loss of life because of cell phone use while driving there is also the issue of distractions. A cellphone is like a computer, a MP3 player, a videogame and many other entertaining things wrapped up in one. Using this addictive piece of technology while driving is like asking for a distraction and distractions or lack of awareness of the road leads to car crashes. There might not be any deaths, but a car crash is still something to avoid. Raising your car insurance? A bad thing. Having to get your car or parent's car repaired? A bad and expensive thing. A distracted driver is a driver more likely to crash and damage their own and others' property.

There are some cars that have automated cellphone connection and touchless operations. Those vehicles do prevent the distractions, but you could still argue it is still just as bad as drunk driving. Your eyes may be on the road, but your attention is focused towards voice commands to your cellphone. It may be loosely related, but you can still be so focused on listening to that text and voicing a response that you alert enough for all the unexpected things that can happen on the road. People find that to be the compromise, but it's also seen as a mental distraction.

Overall cellphones just should not be matched with an activity such as driving. Driving should be a moment to unplug and focus even GPS can be used without the use of your cellphone. Cellphones have been proven to cause car accidents, distractions and crashes. Just keep your hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and attention focused and your cell phone will be waiting on you when you get to your destination.

"Ever been in a car accident due the you or the other driver focusing on cellular devices instead of the road? Have you ever been afraid of having your child drive due to the amount of accidents caused by driver's using their cell phone or any other hand held device? Driver's shouldn't be able to use their cellular devices while in operation of a vehicle. Not only because it directs their focus from the road. But it also increases the overall risk of driving on highways and interstates.

Now while driving your attention should be on two and only two things, the road in front of you and the driver's around you. If your using your cellular devices while driving that's one more thing you have to pay attention to. Not every human can multitask and those who can aren't able to do it well enough to have one hand turning the wheel the other holding a cell phone typing a response to your bestie about how Jacob is a terrible person while our eyes bounce back and forth between the screen and the road. What if while you take a few seconds to type a word a car comes speeding around the corner and you can't react fast enough to swerve out of the way. According to the studies on Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance in volume 27 number 4 details that multitasking is less effective due to your brain having to mentally shift tasks. Which cannot be afforded to do while driving on a open road with other people.

As well as the fact that driving while using your cell phone increases the risk of driving, not only for yourself but the other around you. Think about it if your distacted you are prone to make mistakes, which can be fatal when driving, if you were to turn a little too sharply or not enough it can easily lead to a crash. That puts not only you and the others in your car at risk but everyone else on the same road as well. According to the National Safety Council texting while driving has lead to an astonishing 1.6 million crashes PER YEAR. Now if the risk of crashing that high why take the chance?

Now some people may argue that ""I'm a better driver than others i can text and drive"" or "" No way that can happen to me."" One, get off your high horse their buckoo. Two, According to ACTUAL fact from the National Safety Council 1 in 4 for crashes in the United States will be caused by drivers texting and driving. Is your life really worth a 75% chance that you can get this last text off?

In conclusion, People shouldn't be able to text and drive. If you do you increase the risk of driving which isn't the best thing to do with a already risky activity with roads full of others that you can't tell what they're thinking. But you also distract yourself from the road and it only takes one mistake to cause a deadly crash. So knowing the risks is that last text to Sally really worth your life?

"Driving while using your cell phone has become a very controversial issue currently. Millions of drivers have had mixed feelings and opinions on this subject. In result, people have taken opposing sides. Some believe driving with using your phone isn't such a dangerous task, while others strongly believe it is an action that should never be done by drivers. They argue that this is very unsafe and can distract the driver from paying attention to the road. I agree. I believe that drivers should not use their cellphones while driving.

To begin, driving while using your phone is a very unsafe action. This is because this dangerous action diverts the driver's attention. Drivers are more prone to look at the phone to text or call someone.

When this occurs, drivers are less likely to pay attention to the road, the drivers around them, and their surroundings. Consequently, car accidents are more likely to happen.

On the other hand, some believe driving while using your cellphone isn't a distraction. However, this opinion is false. According to edgarsnyder. com, a credible personal injury law firm, it stated, ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" This statistic shows the absolute dangers driving while texting can cause. All in all, driving and using your phone is very dangerous and unsafe to the driver, passengers, and all people on the road.

In conclusion, driving while using or operating your cellphone is a dangerous act. Drivers should be paying attention to the road, not their phones. Cellphones offer huge distractions due to the easy accessibility to text messaging, video messaging, and all social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat, YouTube, and Facebook. It is a huge distraction and severe consequences will almost always occur.",1
"Phones and Driving

Cell Phones are the biggest world problem, they have taken over the majority of million human life's. Most of the world uses their phones for communication and simply fun for themselves. Unfortunately, Phones are a very distractive device and can also be very deadly if used in the wrong moment.

Humans should not be able to have the capacity to use a phone while driving. The majority of the world think multitasking can come in hand while looking at the road and the phone at the same time. People are taking a risk in their own life and another person's life by making a dangerous decision. Driving with a phone in one hand and the other one on the steering wheel is not what society wants.

When driving most forget about many things and think they are on a road with no one else. It is easy to forget about sharing a road with other people especially when being distracted by phone. When anyones phones makes a sound when it goes off, everyone is always curious to see what is it. Whether or not if it is a text, call, social media like/comment or anything else can pop on a phone. Humans get the audacity to pick up the phone no matter what they are doing. It is against the law to pick up a phone or even make a phone call to anyone. By doing that people are not only risking their own life but everyones life who is on the road.

Hands free devices can still be a danger to many with a car. Many say talking on the phone with a cell phone connected to the bluetooth can also be very distracting. Due to the fact that humans having a conversation on the phone while driving, people are more focused on the conversation than they are with driving the car. In most situations , if you cannot simply wait to answer the phone then waiting at a red light might be acceptable or simply moving going to a parked spot.

Overall, cell phones should be banned on the road at all times to prevent anyone in danger from others. It may not be as convenient, but the world will not lose as many lives especially in the teenager area. A text, a tweet, snapchat, or instagram is not worth risking your life and others just to get a like or a text back. In the future, phones should not be the reason of deaths around the world and should not increase how many kids or adults have died because of it or someone else fault.",1
"The use of cellphones while driving is a topic argued about all over the world. Some people think they have the skills to drive while also using their cell phones, but a large number of people disagree with that belief. People should not drive while using their cell phone because it keeps them from watching the road, it increases accidents, and it also increases highway fatalities.

First, people should not drive while using their cell phone because it keeps them from watching the road. Like texting while driving can lead to a ticket. Another one is answering and talking the phone could cause other to have road rage.

Secondly, people should not drive while using their cell phone because it increases the risk of accidents. Meaning when not looking at the road you could hit someone pet. Another one is when not pay attention to the road you could hit a tree.

Finally, People should not drive while using their cell phone because it can lead to an increase in highway fatalities. When not looking at the highway while your driving you could hit someone in their car. Last year in georgia 1550 people have died in a car accident. Of those 1550 people only 55 were of the use of cell phones. That does not include the number of people being injured of cell phone use.

Being distracted while driving, causing wrecks, and the loss of innocent lives are the three reasons why I think cell phones should be banned while driving. Being distracted while is dangerous. Outlawing the use of phones while driving will greatly reduced the amount of wrecks. If we even save one life by outlawing the use of phones, it will be worth the effort. Help Stop Cell Phone Use While Driving!!!!",1
"Phones & Driving

Phone use while driving is a very bad habit for a lot of drivers. Being on your phone while driving is how most teens get in car wrecks. Cell phones have took over most of these teens lifes. You know it's crazy when a person is willing to risk their life to text somebody back or get on social media. People die everyday in car accidents just because they was on their cell phone while driving. We are all attached to our cell phones it doesn't make no sense. A lot of teens are very guilty of using a cell phone while driving. 94% of teens know that it's dangerous but 34% of them still do it anyways. Studies say that approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their phone while driving. Texting while driving has lead up to 1.6 million crashes in a year. 1 out of 4 car crashes are caused by texting while driving. Most teens will probably own up to phones while driving. The thing about it is that teens are not the only ones texting while driving. There area lot of adults who do it also. When you are talking on a cell phone it is worse than talking to your passenger. Everytime the driver gets a message or a notification they feel as if they also have to look and respond back to it. I feel as if using a cellphone while driving should be banned and against the law. Everytime you take a look at your phone you are putting not only your life but everybody in the car with you in danger. If it is an emergency i feel as if you need to pull over to the side of the road and text or call who ever it is back. Even if the device is hands free it is still dangerous cause you wont be focused on the road you will be focused on if the device is working or not. When you're talking to someone your brain is not all the way focused on the road it's putting energy in the conversation that y'all are having. It can wait until you reach your destination. Because when you text while drive you have to completely move your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road.",1
"Should cellphone use be allowed while driving?

One of the biggest debates in this country is whether or not cellphones should be allowed to be used while driving. Years ago, my sister and I were driving to school as if it was any other school morning. As we approached the green stoplight and midway through the intersection, we were rammed by a truck, who ran a red light. The man in the truck was charged for running a red light and using his cellphone while doing so. This is only one of many accidents that has occurred because of the use of cellphones while driving. Texting and driving can lead to a car wreck, a death or injury of a pedestrian, and are major distractions.

Car accidents are almost frequent every single day. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2009 there were 11 million car accidents across the country. According to the National Safety Council, 25% of all car crashes are related to cellphone use, whether by talking on the phone or texting. Although many people think multitasking is always the answer, it is not the case when it comes down to driving. This is because phones are major distraction, probably the most distractive. Also, texting and driving can lead to the injury or death of a fellow pedestrian walking down the crosswalk. Any person on their phone can drive and accidently hit a pedestrian because the driver was too distracted to look down into their cellphones. Cellphones need to be away from the drivers' hands at all time.

Cellphone use can cause distractions and car accidents, along with the injury or death of a pedestrian. In many states, like Georgia, they have created a law where a driver cannot use his/her cellphone while driving. This law should be in effect nationwide to reduce the amount of deaths caused by accidents; due to the fact that the driver was using his/her cellphone. Texting and driving can lead to many bad things such as car accidents.",1
"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four-time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous, and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always must be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So, the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.

"Driving while the use of cellular devices

Today, most of the society is thoughtless. Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.

The automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.",1
"Phones & Driving

Drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal.

According to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.

According to another article, ""Distracted Driving"" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all while driving.

"Cell Phone Operation While Driving

The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.

Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.

Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.

The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.",1
"Cell phone use should not be legal while driving, it causes many accidents even fatalities. Drivers become careless while driving when using cell phones. Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. The most prevalent distractions are texting and talking on a cell phone while driving. Cell Phone use should not be legal while driving because it will help prevent more accidents and also prevent more deaths. People become distracted while driving when they use cell phones and bring danger into life, the government should regulate stricter laws to citizens about cell phone use on the road.

Drivers are too busy talking on cell phones and not paying attention to the road. Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. Maybe the driver gets a call, gets into an argument, or they are driving too slow. Also another reason is calling while driving can also block out hearing cause the driver is too focused on who is talking, also the driver is less aware of cars around.

This has a big impact on the economy and death rates in the world.

The next reason cell phone use should be illegal while driving is due to texting. This causes the same risks but at a higher rate because you are constantly looking at your phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the driver has no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities.

This is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. Drivers however, underestimate their risks of getting into an accident while using their cell phone on the road. Companies also have this break with reality. They promote things like hand free devices, even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. ""Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.

Overall, they acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk.

State governments should set stricter rules about cell phone use while driving. Death rates are going up rapidly everyday. More and more people are passing away from others not paying attention to their pathway. People are being less cautious and lose focus while being on the road. People should care about their lives and others around them more and should put their phones down until reaching the destination.",1

Driving is a good way to get whatever you need to go in a shorter period of time than on foot. Americans like driving from places such as fast food restaurants to appointments or work. As technology advances and people like to accommodate themselves with technology, we also want this same technology with us even in our vehicles. However if someone is driving with a device I think it is dangerous and can cause serious injuries. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it can be a distraction to not only you but others, can cause a car accident, and it can be illegal . If you are not convinced then I'll explain why driving while on your phone is dangerous.

While driving anywhere you need to always focus on who and what is in your nearby surroundings. In fact, according to driving test.org, ¨ texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving under the influence of alcohol¨ . Since the light refracted off the phone is what you are focused on, vehicles or objects approaching would not get your attention. This is especially true when the phone emits a light with a brighter color or image.

Also best case scenario if you do not cause an accident you may even miss your turn or exit all because you were distracted. Worst case scenario you may cause an accident which I will explain next.

Driving while you are on your phone is not only dangerous because it can be distracting but what happens can lead to a car accident. If you do not take the time to focus on the road, your carelessness may harm pedestrians or other drivers. DrivingTest.org says twenty Texting and Driving makes you 23% more likely to be involved in an accident¨ . It then goes on to say that in 2011, 1.3 million automobiles accidents were caused by this and one can only assume that the numbers have gotten higher with technology advancing. A later text mentions that in 2015

¨3,477 people were killed and 391,000 injured¨ in crashes relating to texting while driving. This can even be illegal are result in murder.

Driving while on your phone can be illegal .If my other two arguments have not you proven that on the phone while driving then hopefully this argument will. Driving while holding your phone is illegal in my state of residence of Georgia. It is illegal under ¨the part of a sweeping hands-free law¨ according to www.usatoday.com `Even though driving with your phone may not be illgeal in your state as stated above it can possibly result in murder. ¨Texting while driving can lead to a homicide charge ¨says pittsburgcriminalattorney.com. The site says you get charged with this if you happen to cause the death of a person due to ¨recklessness¨ or ¨gross negligence¨.

Therefore due to your recklessness of not putting away your phone while behind wheels you can face heavy charges when it could have been prevented.

In conclusion driving with a phone present is a sure way to distract someone and possibly an accident. If that is not convincing then the accident can lead to the death of passengers or other drivers. This will result in heavy charges if deemed responsible for death. Therefore save everyone the trouble by simply putting your device away until you reach your destination or parking real quick. Concluding my argument why drivers should not be able to use a cellphone in any capacity is supported by not my words but professionals as well.",1
"PHONES AND DRIVING

In this world in which we live in, cell phones are a growing market as well as cars. The fact that we depend on cell phones throught the course of our day for numerous reasons.

Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving because its easier to operate a phone in your hand than a cell phone that is not in your hand. Emergencies can occur while driving and you need to report the emergerncy while driving. Cell phones does not cause as big of a distracHon that other things that is done while driving.

A lot of people are in an uproar about driving and using a cell phone and someHmes it is overrated. Trying to operate a cell phone with one hand while maintaining driving has no danger to it. A phone that is mounted on the holder that begins to ring is harder to operate answering, dialing and switching calls.

Most Hmes the mounHng is not secure or has defected parts which can cause more of an issue than having it to your ear. Most people have older cars and cannot a? ord to upgrade and dont have the speaker opHon, which usually allows everyone surrounding your car to know you business.

I cannot say it enough, emergencies happen in a ?ash. Driving and you see a accident that needs emergency aLenHon you need to be able to use the cell phone to call it in. Things happen so quickly now and it could be your phone call that saves their life. Also if a person is lost and no gps signal but calls can be made a person should be able to dial someone by hand and get direcHons out of harms way. Emergency is a big deal in cell phone usage.

Cell phones do not cause as much as a distracHon than people make out to be. As a driver a person should always be aware of the road and be able to mulH-task when using a cell phone. Most Hmes its other things besides a cell phone that cause a distracHon but blames the cell phone as a scapegoat. There could be test on the driver liscence test that we should take to see if were able to drive and talk on the phone instead of just banning it.

Talking on a cell phone and driving a car may be a distracHon for some but not all. It should be our call on if we are focused enough to drive while talking. Although some people are said to have had bad behavior while talking and driving some are very responsible. TexHng and driving is di? erent from talking and driving and that should be the boundary. Each person should be accountable for their acHons just as speeding.",1
"People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multi-tasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can't stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn't be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving. I also think that you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle because it can cause vehicle collisions, slow reaction time, and fatal injuries. Therefore, driving can cause many accidents that can be fatal to the driver and passengers if there is any and cell phones should only be used when not operating a vehicle.

The first reason why the use of cell phones shouldn't be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening. Most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol. When people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor car-following ability and lateral lane control. While under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisions.

As stated before, these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisions.

The second reason why you shouldn't operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction time.

Reaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus. When your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see you're about to get into an accident it would already be too late. Reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds. Reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds. On top of that, drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone. Cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is driving.

The last reason you shouldn't drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have long-term or short-term affects. The affects can be physical, emotional, or psychological. One of the most common physical effect is whiplash. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck. Whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions. One emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving. The last effect is psychological which can cause PTSD. Most car accidents are the results of PTSD but can also be caused by any traumatic experience. PTSD can affect a person's ability to function normally.

People who goes through this will sometimes show a wide range of symptoms including anger, fear, shock, nervousness and feeling of mistrust or guilt.

In conclusion, people shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle. IF they do it can cause life changing accidents and other serious problems in life. Also, it can hurt some people financially causing them to pay for these uneventful occurrences. Some things people can do to prevent is to turn their phone off or put it on ""Do Not Disturb"" mode to prevent any accidents. They can also deal with that they have to do on the phone before starting the car and driving. One more solution is that they can have the passenger relay a message for you using your phone, so you won't be distracted or tempted to pick up the phone.",1
"Texting and driving

Over half of drivers in today's society have this horrible habit of texting and driving. This has to stop immediately, texting and driving puts people's lives at risk. This simple act has caused many fatalities over that last years. Fortunately, the government have put a new law to deal with this problem with our generations problem of texting and driving. I strongly feel that texting and driving is dangerous and should be prohibited.

Diving more into detail, texting and driving is hazardous and life threatening. Just imagine you're on the road driving to your friend's house and someone shoots you a text. You look down not even for 5 seconds; then you accidents swerve into the next lane hitting a car. There are so many different scenarios that could go wrong in that situation. Your life is over just because you couldn't wait to text your friend. The consequences that texting and driving comes with just isn't worth it.

The cost of a life shouldn't be worth a text message, Snapchat or Instagram DM (Direct Message). Texting and driving has taken many lives. In a recent article I read it said ""2017 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics. In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 421,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2017, 11% of drivers under age 20 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash."" This cannot go on any longer we must do something to stop these numbers from increasing.

Luckily the government has enforced a brand new law called ""Hands Free"".

This law states Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving. If you don't follow these laws they can fine you fifty to one hundred and fifty dollars. I feel that this action was necessary and justified to better protect our society.

Over all texting and driving is dangerous, has killed many people and is now on the decline thanks to the new "" Hands Down"" law.",1
"explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle

Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones when driving because they can be severely injured or worse die. The number of crashes related to a phone and texting have made the use of a phone while driving illegal. Also the non use of a cell phone behind the wheel saves countless lives everyday.

Some states have also enacted laws to ban cell phone use. In the United States risk of automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than if they weren't on their phone.

Driving with a cell phone has been the main cause of vehicle crashes over the last decade. Which led to most states banning the use of the device completely. However One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Strong evidence that both retrieving and, in particular, sending text messages has a detrimental effect on that individual that increases their urge to use it. Although using a hands free device may sound better however in reality it's not since your attention isn't always on the road. All drivers should refrain from there cell phones.",1
"Should drivers be able to be on their phone while driving? My opinion to that question would be no for many reasons. You shouldn't have any distractions while driving. Way too many people are killed in car accidents and there doesn't need to be any other distractions while driving. Driving while using a cell phone is a vision distraction, it's law enforced, and it's a hazard to other drivers.

Any form of usage on a cell phone while being in the car is dangerous in many ways. Drivers need to sit back and think is texting or calling anyone at this very second worth a risk of taking or endangering not only my own life but risking it for any one else's.

Using a phone not only causes danger, but causes many forms of distraction and disorder. It can be physically danger in and kind of situation, it is mentally distracting depending on what the cause is, and can even become an issue not only with the protection of human but a problem with the law. Doing anything on the phone in that very moment is not worth taking anyone, yet their own life's but yet not worth getting into trouble that could've been avoided.

It's safer to have someone in the car with you, talking to you rather than you being on your phone. The passenger in the car can keep you company and keep you entertained. A cell phone will distract you and you could take your life and even someone else. Being on your phone could make you drive slower and cause other vehicles to pass you and that could cause an accident.

Drivers should not have in their possession at any time a cell phone. It's too much of a risk. There is no need for a snapchat or a game can't wait in order to not take you own life or someone else's. There is enough distractions while driving without it being a phone. A phone only makes it all worse.",1
"Everyone knows that texting and driving is a terrible idea, but only a few people seem to understand why. Using cellphones while driving is never a good mix for anyone. The generation now don't know the meaning of texting and driving. There are bad wrecks happening while driving and texting on the road. Drivers should never use their phone while driving. On your phone can really cause you to swerve off and on the road leading you to be in the other persons lane. Taking your eyes off the road has obvious disadvantages and it degrades our attention.

90% of car crashes is mostly the drivers fault, they mostly use the excuse of ""recognition error"". When you are in a divided conversation your attention is in different places like the road, a person in the car with you, or a phone call. All those distractions only one should mainly have your attention which i suggest be the road, and us as human we only have a little of attention to spare. Texting on a phone while driving can make you react more slowly to what your main focus should be on. We also feel immune to the risks of other people. Many of us have a lot of experience making bad decisions and suffering the consequences. It feels reasonable to infer that we are able to text and drive safely but some people may chose not to thinking they can do them all in any way. Remember the real reason why it's terrible to text and drive.",1
"Operating a motor vehicle while on your cell phone

Being on your device and driving could be an overly dangerous choice in life. Many people around the world are injured by this situation every day. It could lead to accidents and altercations. In addition it would even cost you your licences. The most detrimental outcome is death. There are far more outcomes to operating a motor vehicle while being on a cell phone. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle.

One leading cause to motor vehicle accidents is being on your cell phone. It could lead to accidents and altercations. Yourself and the passengers are more at risk to bodily injuries and harm. These bodily injuries and harm can range anywhere from mild to critical condition. In an motor vehicle accident there is more than one involved. There is another person or group of people that could have the exact same conditions than the driver on the cell phone. In an example of an altercations you could be more prone to damaging an building or such. An direct result of an event in place; a fee or very large payment would need to be made. Secondly another consequence could be having your license taken.

When you have violated a driving law there will always be an consequence. Rather it being jail time, injuries, or more. Your license will be subjected to suspension. A suspended license defines as you are not able to drive until they are reinstated. The process can take anywhere from a short period of time or even a long period of time. The average time for a suspended license is sixty days.

For some people if it is not your first offense they may even take your license for good. Furthermore there is another cause to driving while being on your cell phone.

After all the consequences the most detrimental is death. Many people happen to pass away due to a motor vehicle car accident. Not all people pass away at the crash site, some has a condition mild to critical that causes them to die. Around 1.6 million people a year die in motor vehicle accidents. Out of the 1.6 million, 1 out of 4 pass away because drivers are on their cell phone. That includes the driver and the unlucky few that may have been in the car, around, or in another car. Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations, suspension of license, and even death. Prevention is simply not being able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle. Take a moment to focus on the road.

You are able to check your phone when you reach a red light or a complete stop. This is one step closer to its prevention. It will save many lives even your own.",1
"Phones & Driving Essay

I believe that drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving because it is an attention hazzard. Driving with your phone in hand is not only illegal but very dangerous, but driving without the distraction of a phone can lower the driving fatality rates by a lot. Also, there are apps and programs on the phones that help drivers go hands free. Last, having that phone as a distraction while driving can cause a significant lowering of you reaction time and attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

First and foremost, Driving without the phone as a distraction will generally lower the fatality rates of distracted driving accidents. Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of self-control is the reason why people get distracted by their phones, especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents.

Furthermore, Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people, objects, and other cars on the road, with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident. Also, looking for pedestrians crossing while distracted just makes driving harder than it has to be.

Finally, There are various things that have been put in place to keep the driver from getting distracted by their phones, For example apps and programs on the phones that keep the driver from checking or responding to their phones. It prevents the driver from getting phone calls, texts, and other notifications while in the car. Another example, the hands-free laws that hold the people that like to drive with phone in hand accountable. Last is personal accountability, keeping yourself in check and safe but not just yourself but the people in the car with you and the other cars.

In conclusion, Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot, there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts, but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road, and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.",1
"Although cell phones have been around for quite some time, they have become a key part of our lives. We use cell phones for anything now such as: texting, social media, calls, schedule planning, etc. Unfortunately, we are choosing to use them at the wrong time and wrong place, while we are driving. As time is going by, we are getting more and more into the phones that we don't care about our personal safety or others safety. Using cellphones while driving can be extremely dangerous to the drivers and others around them for many reasons.

When we are driving it can be exceedingly difficult to focus on the surroundings around us and easy to forget that you are sharing the road with other people and not just yourself. Other drivers take notice when drivers are on their phones whether they want to or not because of the danger they can cause. Erratic driving is something that we all get worked up about because it can make us late or can be inconvenient to us. Drivers also tailgate you because they can't keep the constant speed because they are on their phones. Sometimes pedestrians are killed because people are on their phones and don't pay attention to their surroundings. We may not intend to end someone's life, but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our life.

Everyday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving. According to my research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers. Research shows that being on your phone while driving can cause the risk 4x more of a horrible crash. Because we use cell phones more often now, we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to keep in touch with people. They also think that the hand-free is a safe thing to use because they are driving with two hands instead of holding the phone.

Driving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that they cause, it causes someone's insurance to rise, and it causes concerns to people's health. I think people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others. Research has proven that people who use cell phones while driving are more prone to be/cause an accident. People who use cell phones while driving does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. It also can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that could lead to tragedy.

In conclusion, people should stop texting and driving because it can cause serious damage. Not only that it can take someone's life. Texting while driving is a serious problem today because we are on our phones 24/7 and we don't usually put it down. We are distracted by our phones to the point where we shouldn't be able to drive with a phone in the car because of how long we are on our phones. Driving and texting should be banned before we lose more people.",1
"Have you ever seen an ambulance or two with a few cop cars rushing by and thought what's going on? Many people who are caught up in these types of situations do it to themselves by using their phones, causing accidents and injury that shouldn't have happened. This needs to stop, maybe even be helped if it can't be stopped.

Many people get upset when new rules coming out trying to limit phone use while driving. This shouldn't be the case though as they are just trying to prevent any unnecessary injury. This could also mean time in jail for the driver for being on his or her phone in the first place. This again causes unnecessary problems that could be avoided. The person who was using their phone would also have to pay a fee for the damages to the vehicle or even the person.

Another reason people shouldn't be able to use cell phones all the time is because there's always a time where and ambulance is driving by or even a cop. Most people would pull to the side. On the other hand, if your blasting and unaware of your surrounding because your using your phone you wouldn't be able to hear them unless they were right next to you. This could cause injury to whoever they were rushing to get to. If it was a cop It would be bad for the driver blasting music too. Not being able to use the phone keeps you safer and out of trouble.

A way to make it somewhat safe for phone use however is to have a Bluetooth connection in the car. This is a pretty good compromise. People can just use their car to control phone needs. All calls can be answered and texts can be read without looking at a phone. This will keep the person safe and make looking at the phone less of a problem. This however wouldn't stop all problems which is why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in capacity while driving.

In conclusion driving around in general isn't the safest thing ever. Adding an extra distraction that makes driving even more dangerous isn't smart. People shouldn't be mad at laws made because people make bad decisions while driving. Laws are made to keep us safe so if a law to not let people use phones it would help stop accident and other unnecessary injuries or problems.",1
"Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. Cell phones are now starting to be a part of life using everyday technology to do a lot of stuff. Paring this and driving is not a good combination, why you shouldn't do it and how it effects people.

Drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. For example, It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst-case could kill them self or other people.

Reports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because of texting and driving. There are a lot of other reasons why not to do it to. First of you must set an example towards the passengers that are in your car rather it be your kids or you friends. Secondly its illegal in a lot of places but Texas is one of the only seven states that have yet to completely ban texting and driving. Lastly and the one that gets told a lot is that your eyes are taken off the road, A person is 23 times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while sending a text message, than if they were only driving. That number towers over the other activities associated with distracted driving.

In conclusion you should never texting and driving it is the most leading cause of death within motor vehicle crashes.",1
"Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death. The biggest age group affected by this problem would have to be teens aging from 16 up to adults aging around 30. In the end, no one benefits from this problem other than the law enforcement team who has worked so hard to stress the importance of no texting while driving and funeral homes that are being paid for burial expenses. The reason I say that the law enforcement benefit from the problem would have to be because this is an example of exactly what it is that they try so hard to avoid. Funeral homes benefit because most of these cases end in a tragic accident that allow the funeral home to prepare a home going ceremony. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person continue to text and drive. People really need to understand how easily it is take the life of someone else or even themselves. And most of the time in many cases relating to this particular problem, it is always is the age groups ranging from 16 years of age to 30 years of age. I wish that this problem can get resolved quickly to avoid many accidents and death.",1
"Should Drivers Be Allowed To Use Cell Phones When Driving?

Why Driver's should desist from using their Cell Phones while DrivingHundreds of research indicate that using the cell phone while driving is a dangerous prospect that leads to loss of lives. Statistically, 50 minutes of phone chatter while driving increases the likelihood of a car crash or car accident almost five-fold (Crundall, 2017). Texting has also emerged as an issue but many reported cases indicate talking on the cell phone while driving. In the United States, 20 states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones, while another 48 states have banned text messaging while driving (National Conference of State Legislature [NCSL], 2019). Surprisingly, no state is yet to pass laws banning cell phone use across a multitude of drivers, and this explains the continued rise in cell phone-use induced car and road accidents. The majority of drivers and motorists claims that 'being distracted by mobile phones"" is the leading cause of car and road accidents.

One major issue concerns the risk of using one hand to navigate bends and respond to potential hazards while talking on the phone. According to Crundall (2017), the majority of roads accidents in Europe occur in steep slopes, bends and corners, with 35% of them involving the driver communicating on his/her cell phone. Another issue involves the act of conversation which leads to a loss of concentration - cognitive processing - that ultimately leads to an accident (NCSL, 2019). Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University conducted a simulation study and discovered that the human spatial brain activity is affected when performing dual-task, leading to loss of concertation and hence accidents (Crundall, 2017). Processing of auditory messages becomes a problem when driving and communicating on a cell phone, explaining why a driver, under no circumstances, is required to use his/her cell phone while driving.

"Phone and Driving

Throughout the years people have lost their lives due to the use of their cellular phones. Using phones while driving could be dangerous for everyone that's on the road 24/7. Innocent people that go to work a drive every day put their lives at risk for other people that drive while using their phones. Phones should not be used while driving.

People that use their phones while driving put their lives at risk for the simple fact that they could cause an accident on the highway or even in the streets. People choose the wrong moment while driving to look at their phones and sometimes forget that they share the road with other innocent people and they turn what could simply be a normal day to a tragic ending on a person's life. Phones haven't been out for that long and we as humans can get so distracted by just looking down at your phone and not being aware of the cars around you or in front of you. Every year more people die for causing an accident while using their phone or is killed by a person thats on their phone when not supposed to.

In the U.S., 4637 people died in car crashes in 2018 due to cell phone use. Including the cost of people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion dollars. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 millions crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving , these mortality death rates are from every country that people are able to have a phone. One out of four cars accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. however , the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car accidents. On average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to people that are distracted by their phones while driving.

Ways that we can prevent accidents of people using their phones while driving is that people should put their phone on silent or out of reach. People should be able to use their phone if they are going to a certain location and they need to use their GPS. car accidents are mostly caused by the fact that nowadays teenagers have the privilege of driving around with innocent people that go to work to bring food to the table. Most teenagers know the risks that their lives could be at risk while driving. According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyways. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accident were distracted by their cell phones.",1
"Cell phones were presented within the United States showcase within the decade of 1980 and their utilization right away developed amid the following two decades. The slant of utilizing cell phones has expanded all through the world. One of the essential reasons for the tremendous development of cell phones is that they encourage communication advertising tall levels of adaptability coming to craved individuals inside seconds whether he/she is at office, domestic, or exterior driving a car etc. Cell phones back in making a coordinate contact with individuals successfully and without wastage of any time. Another fundamental reason for the hazardous development of cell phones is the security viewpoint. Cell phones make it simple to contact amid crisis indeed amid driving in spite of the fact that utilizing cell phones whereas driving is generally perilous and not fitting, it gives the comfort of handling crisis circumstance, tuning in music through hands-free, and following courses etc.

In case drivers on cell phones have more mischances, at that point drivers ought to be precluded from utilizing them. Drivers on cell phones do have more mishaps. Hence, drivers ought to be disallowed from utilizing cell phones. To create this contention, you must clarify and protect both of its premises, and they require very diverse contentions.

A few investigations recommend that talking on a cell phone whereas driving is viably like driving whereas impeded. In reality, a ponder at the College of Utah that compared tanked drivers to drivers on cell phones indeed found that ""cell phone drivers displayed more noteworthy impedance than inebriated drivers"". Ouch. A costly mineral called coltan may be a component of cell phones. It can stand up to warm and store an electrical charge. It's found basically in locales of the Equitable Republic of Congo, and the mining and generation preparation regularly includes child/youth work and natural dangers.

Eleven states have sanctioned a few sort of confinements with respect to cell phone utilization whereas driving.

Florida incorporates a particular law concerning cell phones with headsets, stipulating that the headset permits exterior sounds to be listened through at slightest one ear.

"Phones and Driving

Should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle. According to the article ""Cellphone Use While Driving Statistics and Texting and Driving Facts"" states that according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. ""Talking or texting while driving or checking social media posts takes eyes off the brain off the task of driving"":

states a message that phones has become a distraction to the human brain, but not only distracting the human brain, but is also becoming a habit to human beings.

Distraction has become a huge part in car crashes and people's injuries. Cellphones has become an important component to many human routines. Therefore, it doesn't come to a surprise or a shocked moment that gadgets such as cellphones, tablets, or any other technology devices are ambiguous. Phones not only put the driver in danger, but also other people such as passengers and the other driver in danger.

So for that exact reason, many states implemented the law to not text while driving or you will get a big, fine ticket just for the safe of other people .",1
"I am typing about why drivers should not use phones while driving. This is my opinion and I will be backing it up. It is also a law all over the world. Not texting or being on your phone can save lives if you are driving.

I say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life.

If you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.",1
"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. A cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a wreck. People still use cell phones because they want to be available and keep in touch with other people. They think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. They use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

People whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. They can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to an injury.. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. Hands Free don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. It show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. People have proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man work, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.",1
"Drivers Should Be Limited As To When They Can Use Their Phones While Driving

Drivers who are distracted by their phone while driving have an increased risk of crashing. Crashes affect both the crasher and any possible crashing victims. Everything from physical pain to emotional pain as well as financial pain can be felt after a crash. 3,287 deaths happen every day due to fatal car crashes. On average, 9 of these fatalities are related to distracted driving. Due to the inability to test if a crash was due to distracted driving, it is believed that the recorded number of distracted driving incidents is greatly under-recorded.

Over 80% of drivers admit to not paying attention to the road while they are doing blatantly hazardous behaviors while driving. The listed activities are not always the driver interacting with their phone, however it is safe to assume that interacting with their phone is one of the many hazardous activities these drivers admitted to doing. Distracted driving is now considered to be the ""new drunk driving"" since it follows the same psychological pattern. With recent studies of phone addiction showing some of the same signs as drug addiction, people are having a harder time ignoring their phone. It is no coincidence that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.s and that 16-19 year olds have a three times higher chance to be involved in a fatal crash than any other age group while studies show that teens and younger children are the most addicted to their phones.

While it is dangerous to be interacting with your phone while driving some people have no choice in the matter. Reasons for this can range from work related texts or phone calls to family matters. Some states are trying what is called a ""hands free law"" that makes it illegal for a driver to hold their phone while they are driving. It also states that a driver cannot read or watch videos on their phone while driving. Because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages. The law along with the accessories allow these types of drivers to access their phones, though very limited, and keep up to date with their important concerns.

The hands free law and the accessories could make the open roads a little safer for everybody while allowing people to keep their phones in their car but it is important to remember that no matter how many laws are put into place, people will still continue to abuse them and accadences will still happen. It comes down to the individual and how properly educated they are and whether or not they can mentaly handle a responsibility like driving.",1
"BOOM!! You're on I-75 on the ground bleeding out watching everyone surrounding you, calling 911.

At this point you're thinking to yourself, ""why the freak did this happen?"" A couple hours later you found out an adult was on his phone texting and driving before the wreck happened, which is the most selfish thing to do while driving. Putting your life and other's lives in danger just so you can send a stupid text to your girl/boyfriend is completely selfish. I firmly believe that we need stricter phone laws to in jail people.

Texting while driving is in the top five causes for deaths, and yet many states do not have laws against it. We need to stand together united and encourage our Congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distraction.

and be mature and adult-like and discuss ways to not further endanger each other.

Cellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it, but I know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change. What's more important to you: a notification or somebody's life? Our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make the roads safer for everyone, we as people need to come together an decide what to do to make things happen, we don't know how much more accidents have to happen in order to push it into effect.

We dedicate our selves to our phones,we cant go 10 minuets without trying to see if we got a notification, the time we spend on our phones is tremendous its up to 6 hours a day! Not including the time spent in your bed! If there were something to happen to all of our phone we would go insane,if we would just make stricker laws for phone an driving the people would stop because of the consequences.",1
"I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing ones insurance to rise, and it is causing concerns to people health issues. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with the their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the electronic device. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about it also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason to ban the ususage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising.",1
"Phones and Driving

Look around you! All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.

Phones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. ""About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year"" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article ""Mobile phones and driving safety"", it stated that,""In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving."" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.

Many people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of "" Teen driver source"", ""In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.""The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on ""Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.

Both the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.

Each state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.

In conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.",1
"Imagine waking up to a call in the middle of the night saying you lost your loved one in a car accident because they decided a text was more important than their life? Texting while driving increases the risk of an accident 23.2 times compared to unimpaired driving which is a sobering statistic provided by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in 2018. Using the phone while driving has spread throughout the nation, and with people being so impatient in today's society, texting and driving has had damaging effects on people and their families. Phones have become a key part of our lives but it's our job as people to know when and where to use our phones especially as drivers. Driving while distracted by the phone can affect everyone involved physically, mentally, as well as financially.

Driving and texting is something very common, but a serious problem with detrimental effects. The main detrimental effect could be physical. When a person texts and drives, a person could cause an accident, which could not only endanger themselves, but it could endanger others.

According to the National Safety Council, ""Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year."" These are deaths added to this already hectic world that could have been easily avoided.

Not only can texting while driving affect a person physically but it can also affect a person mentally.

While physical damage to a vehicle or physical injury to a person can often be resolved in a matter of days or weeks, emotional damage may last a lifetime. Author and blogger Rebecca Goldfarb recently categorized the types of emotional damage as shock, anger, guilt, anxiety and depression and even post-traumatic stress. Goldfarb added many people who are involved in an accident as either the driver or as the victim often need to receive professional care if the difficult emotions are lasting longer than expected.

The final way in which driving while distracted may negatively affect a person is financially. According to the website big AZ BIG Media, there are six types of costs that may happen following a car accident. The first two immediate financial costs involve the repair of personal property and the costs with healthcare and medical treatment. The second two financial costs involve possible legal fees and an increase to car insurance. Finally, the last two costs involve the loss of employment (income and benefits) and the possible cost of a career change if the person cannot return to their job.

In conclusion, texting while driving is not a wise decision. Texting while driving can negatively affect everyone involved physically, mentally and even financially. Oprah Winfrey summarized this point on April 26, 2010 on her website with these words ""But this is a real problem we can do something about and get immediate results. All we have to do is hang up or switch off. It really is that simple. Once we do that, not another son or daughter will have to die because someone was on the phone and behind the wheel-and just not paying attention."" The solution is simple, don't text and drive.",1
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody",1
"Phones and Driving

Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed.

In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.

As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field (""Distracted Driving"") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.

Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .

"There shouldn't be a discussion when it comes to texting and driving for obvious reasons. It's just as dangerous as driving under the influence. And there are plenty of ways to send a message using hands free technology. It also being illegal should really mean that you shouldn't be doing it. And you can also kill someone just to send a text message. But it is common in the United States.

Texting and driving has been banned in most of the United States there are only 2 states that haven't banned texting and driving. And of you get caught by a cop you will be fined up to $400. And that is a lot of money for just sending a text. And may also cause your license to get suspended. It makes sense because when you text and drive you are twenty three percent more likely to get into a car crash. That makes just as dangerous as driving under the influence.

A lot of people don't actually know how dangerous and common texting and driving really is. It makes up eighteen percent of fatal car crashes. And more than 35 percent of teens and adults admit to texting and driving. So even though people know what could happen they still do it either way. And more then ninety percent of people know how dangerous texting and driving is. People take there eyes off the road for four seconds on average which is long enough for you to swerve on to another lane. And at least 9 people are killed every day by distracted drivers.

There are plenty of easy ways to prevent texting and driving. One way is to have your phone out of reach and on silent so if you get a message or a call you won't be able to get tempted to reach for your phone. Another way is to use an app to block incoming texts or calls. Some apps can send an auto response back, letting the sender know that you are driving and will respond when you are not driving. And one way is to be committed to not texting and driving.

In conclusion texting and driving and driving distracted is a big problem that can easily be avoided. But people still tend to do it anyways. People should pay a fine if caught by a police officer. And should get there license suspended if they do it a lot. People should be more aware about the consciences that can be caused by this petty action. To keep it simple would you drive 1 ton of pure machinery at 60 miles per hour blindfolded.",1
"Not Using Phones while Driving

Throughout the years, teenagers have been eager to turn 16. Driving is a nerve wrecking and exciting experience at the same time. There is a good upside about driving and that would be being able to go out to places without having to pay and the time period you can stay out for is how long you desire. Even though there is a good side, there is a bad side as well. This would have to be the large amount of people that are not cautious around their surroundings and many lives have been taken away due to this. I would have to agree with the idea that says that phones should not be used while driving , my reasons for this are that peoples lives are taken away, a phone is a big distraction, and it is a law you have to follow.

My first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because too many lives are taken everyday. Utilizing a phone while driving takes many lives every second of our daily lives. About 1.6 million lives a year end up in critical conditions or worse, dead. A phone call or text can wait, but being impatient can result in deaths. This impatiences creates danger to the person driving and everyone around them. Too many lives are taken by near accidents, crashes, distractions, and running of lights caused by usage of phones by operating moving vehicles. Many more lives could be safer if people chose to wait for their usage of phones after being off the road.

My second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because, too many distractions are already on the road without adding a phone as another reason. Once again, using a phone while driving creates too many distractions for the driver and everyone around is left in danger. For example, phones can create delays on stop lights which can create simple accidents. The glare of a bright phone on a dark night can actually interfere with the sight of the driver and can cause loss of control or misguidance to swerving. As well as sudden loud sounds from a phone can actually scare or frighten a driver straight to a crash. Occuping phones while driving is one of the biggest reasons for caused crashes all over.

My third and final reason for not using phones while driving is because, a new law recently has been released on how using phones on the road is no longer permitted anymore. The new law was put in to ensure more safety due to all the distractions caused by phones. Since it is a new law, a new law means that it is expected to be followed, a new set out rule. It is for the safety of people and everyone surrounding. People will get punished if the new law is not followed and in my opinion, i would say that it is one of the greatest laws forced. The new law will minimize the amount of crashes caused by phones on the road all over and save many more lives and everyone around.

A phone should not ever be used while a person is driving for any type of situation, it can wait. My reasons, once again like i said before is that many lives are taken away, it is also a big distraction, and last would be that it is a new law. A phone is really entertaining and that is something people do not want behind the wheel because then it can become a distraction.

Through the whole essay all I could come to head would be about the peoples lives taken away left with a broken down family. Phones ultimately should not be used while driving and a person should not have to double think it, before they cause a new tragedy that will leave them with a lifetime of consequences and guilt.",1
"Should drivers be allowed to use cellphones while driving?

Drivers should not be allowed to text while drive is what I believe statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teens. 12 million car crashes in 2013 involved crashes in text messages. Texting while driving show that this multitasking at least 341,000 behind the wheel is becoming more dangerous and life threatening now. Because technology will change and new distractions will be involved. According to research conducted at children's hospital teens who don't frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away there the phones while driving outweigh any drawbacks such as being able to pay attention better on the road, and being less likely to have crash and also following the law. Parents should also avoid talking to students as that can also be a big distraction for them. Cellphones aren't just about texting but multi behaviors it's about anything that can cause a distraction from the road such as social media apps , and music have the potential to draw away from the road. Cellphone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. Texting is undeniably the most dangerous thing a person can do while on the road and its becoming more and more common as the leading causes of death from car crashes are just that and intoxication. Today the majority of humans own and operate cellphones on a daily basis and that's a distraction from what they're doing and can be very dangerous when your driving because you aren't paying any attention to the road and can kill someone.

Something as simple as calling someone can also be dangerous but it's not the leading cause of death. from driver's messages and keeping your eyes on the road is and that's really a major dilemma for someone else who's unaware of that. so I believe that in the future people should always make to keep an open eye for this because it can be very life threatening.

I would consider this age the phone boom since widely now everyone has or owns a communication device and this allows for simple talking and texting time now moves a lot faster than before so people are now trying to catch up with it and that can really become distraction for a lot of people. And those really aren't safe anymore because that can cause car crashes and even death that put you and someone else at a high risk paying attention and being aware is very important you don't want be the cause of someone's death or maybe even a child's death because you were to ignorant to follow the basic law so my plan would be to limit the use of phones on the road while driving and allowing only when you are parked.

The general driving statistics on the national safety reports that that texting while driving made a dramatic increase of 1.6 million crashes an estimated year high. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

The statistics?

While driving and texting may seem not that much to worry about the death toll seems to speak much for itself. 1 out of 4 accidents and car crashes happen because texting and phone use during driving this seems to be all too common for teens in some areas because according to the AA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting which also means there aware of the safety concerns these situations tend to have people nationwide. Teens are more susceptible to car crashes the likely hood of adults they are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near crashes than adults are prone too. A teen driver who has a passenger in the car doubles the risk more than 5x likely. A cellphone use becomes a national problem there never a reason to risk your life and someone else's to get a simple text in the chances of getting into a car crash with a passenger increase don't be careless is the importance of this drive safe.",1
"Texting and Driving

Driving will always need your undivided attention at all times. There are many obvious reasons you shouldn't text and drive. You can get in a wreck, hit a pedestrian, and it puts your life at risk. Driving is a privilege and you should always follow the rules of the road. Using your mobile device can put you and the people around you in danger.

First of all, Texting and driving can get you in a terrible car wreck. When your on your phone your reaction time is bad. You can miss a stop sign and another car can come from the left or right side of you and you wouldn't see it coming. This can also raise your insurance rate up or you can be sued depending on how bad the accident is. Why risk it when you can wait or pull over to send that text? When you're looking down might not see pedestrians cross the street.

Besides getting into a car wreck you can also injure another person for being careless. Driving in a neighborhood needs your full attention. If you use your mobile device in a neighborhood you can either hit a pet, a jogger, or even a child if you're not paying attention. If such thing happens you can either get sued or go to jail for manslaughter. This is another major reason why you shouldn't be using your phone on the road.

Most importantly, getting distracted by your cell phone can put your life and other people's lives at risk. The most common deaths road deaths are caused by someone who were on their phones. You crashing can also cause a domino effect with other cars hitting each other on an intersection or a highway. That one text is not worth putting your life and other people's lives at risk. You don't want to end up in the hospital or even worse end up dead.

In conclusion, you should never use your phone while driving under no circumstances. If you need to make an emergency call, you should invest in a bluetooth hands free radio to make your phone calls. It is your duty to make the road you drive in safe for yourself and others. Make sure your eyes are always on the road no matter what.",1
"Phones and Driving

In today's current society almost everyone in the world has access or owns a cellular device. That device that can call text or email right from your pocket. While it is so very useful it can also become quite distracting to someone who might be driving. Which leads to the point that Drivers should not be able to access their phones while driving. In these cases its smart to look at the annual driver and cell phone related instances that have happened over the years as well as the averages of crashes involving phones and the driver.

Cell Phone users while they are driving are 5.36 times more likely to get into an accident when driving accordion to a study done at the University of Utah (""Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks."" University of Utah News, archive. unews. utah. edu/news_releases/drivers-on-cell-phones-are-as-bad-as-drunks/). These statistics show how more likely a driver is to get in an accident while on their cell phones. That isn't a small number 5.36 is a larger number of people when taking into account how many use their phones while driving anyways. This leads into how many people actually die to chances like these.

In 2015 alone there were 3,477 people killed in a distracted driver accident. 476 of which in those cases were cell phone users.(""Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving."" EndDD, www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoaz3BRDnARIsAF1RfLevzm7d8WG_o9fmbSLCDrfzuhq4pSz6LYGnFCL65o0N-OBsj-T8u8YaAh1_EALw_wcB.). These numbers when taking into account how those deaths could have been prevented by simply putting the phone down while driving are extremely high. That is 13 percent of all drivers that died last year were on their phones. And those people would still be alive had they put the phone down.

These statistics do not lie when saying how people die due to cellular phones being used while driving. With that when 13 percent of the annual driving related deaths are all cellphone based and with the ever growing world that number will go up. That is unless the Driver puts the phone downs while he drives.",1
"Phones and Driving

In this day in age of technological advancement, mankind has quickly adapted to using devices such as cellphones. It has gotten to the point where we constantly use it for everything we do. There seems to be many good qualities about the cellphone which humans seem to keep all are attention on. That in turn causes problems with our surroundings such as being on the phone and driving a vehicle.

There is no denying that cellphones take up all of our attention. There are just so many things that we are able to do that makers have put in it. It is just to ensure that we never get bored while also waiting for the next phone with technological superiority to be released. Likewise, with driving. It takes up all of our focus to make sure we don't get into a car wreck. In a way, driving and being on a cellphone are very similar in regards to how much attention we give it. So when putting both together, the ending result are what you would expect it to be, catastrophic.

Cellphones and driving take up a lot of focus and because of that, we constantly are switching from looking at our phones to paying attention to the road and oncoming traffic ahead (assuming there is any that is). They do not balance out well and people can easily get into car accidents as a result. This most notably happens when a person is trying to text and drive at the same time. It was this very reason why texting and driving has been made illegal to ensure the safety of fellow drivers. You would think the problems lay with teenagers doing it, but adults have a higher statistic level when it comes to this, providing more fatality rates to go up. Add that in with alcohol and there is no telling what will happen.

In the end, we just should not use our phones while we drive. It quickly turns into a habit once we start and it will not end well. It can also result in being arrested if caught by a local police officer. We should get everything out of the way before we start driving or stop and park somewhere before we engage into the activities on our phone. There are plenty of safe ways to use a phone while inside of a vehicle, we just choose the most dangerous route.

"Young adults and teens can not put their phone down for a second. Any notification they receive is so important to them. The first thing they do is check and see what popped up on their phone. The worst time for this to happen is when they're driving because they will still cheak no matter what they're doing. Using your phone while driving can cause you to get a ticket, cause you to hurt someone, and even cause you to hurt yourself.

People may think nothing of driving and being on their phone. Police always advertise to let others know not to use their phones while driving but they refuse to listen. Now if a police officer catch anyone on their phone while driving they will get a ticket. Everyone hates when authority stops them. It's the worst feeling ever and to make it worst is for the reason to be just being on your phone.

If people are driving and on their phone they're not focused on what's in front of them. Anything can pop up in front of the vehicle at any time. Things like animals, people, and even cyclist can appear in front once you up from your phone. The only problem is the driver may not look up in time and hit someone or something. There is a possibility that whoever the driver hit could suffer major injuries or even death.

Not only are you putting others in danger, you're also putting yourself in danger. Like mentioned before, anything can pop up in front of you vehicle. This time around it can be another car, truck, or even a bus. Crashing into one these just from being on a phone can possibility cause instant death. Maybe you might have quick reflexes and try to avoid collision. There is a possibility still hit something else like a tree. Some may be lucky enough to only be injured or not harmed at all.

In the end, using your phone while driving can result in you getting in serious trouble or causing harm to yourself and others. Authority can stop you if they notice it. Other citizens can harmed by you for not paying attention. Also you can harm yourself. Just do not do it because it's not worth it. It can wait.",1
"Have you ever been behind someone that has been on there phone and didn't know the light was green or when someone almost hit you because they didn't see you because they were looking at their phone?

To start things off, I believe that there is a time and place for being on your phone with behind the wheel. If you are at a red light and you don't have to type or just have to answer a call or change a song i believe that is an acceptation to the rule of being on your phone. Since we are in the time and age were we have Bluetooth in cars and can connect to our phones so it makes it easier to call and or answer calls. Texting and driving is a must stop because you may think that you will be fine and can multitask but in reality you are putting you and the other drivers in danger. No one's parents should have to attend their child's funeral because they died from texting and driving or because someone else was texting and driving. There are many reasons not to use a phone while driving but there are also exceptions to this rule now you may not agree with me on this but this to me is the best actions to do because people will not stop with getting on their phones while driving but at least we could limit it to just a few ways that they could get on it while being behind the wheel.

Secondly, with technology still evolving in this day like now they are getting driverless cars that may be the next big step in the world of vehicles. Now with these cars we don't need to worry about the needs of driving cars if there is no steering wheel.

Every day about 11 teens die due to texting and driving in the United States but with today's technology they are trying to help stop texting and driving but everything we do doesn't seem to be helping and or stopping teens from texting behind the wheel. Some people still might not agree with me on what I believe is important but if you just give it some years maybe just maybe it may be possible in today's society that no one can get hurt from texting and driving.

Lastly, although it's a big problem for people to stop texting and driving, it's not a ban in every state in the United States. It's said that only 39 states put a ban for novice drivers because it isn't the biggest deal for some people to be able to text and drive which I know doesn't sound great but it's kind of the truth in a way. I personally have no experience of this because I can't drive but i see people who do drive and do this and it's not like it's every time it mainly at red lights you see them doing it. Now out the 39 states 20 of them ban it for school bus drivers also.

It's taken the USA almost 14 years and people still don't listen to no texting and driving.

To conclude, have you ever been behind some or seen someone texting and driving? I got to tell you some facts that maybe you didn't know about texting and driving and even I learned something new. I also gave some changes that could happen in the near future that could change how we see texting and driving.",1
"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become mandatory in most of our lives. Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways.

Driving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family.

I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states -- Arizona, Montana, and Missouri -- insanely do not have laws against texting while driving.

According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives.

In conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. I Think you can wait to answer that text.",1
"Don't Touch the Screen

As we drove to the final basketball game of the season against our rivals Milton High School, I was having a great time with my best friend. Paige and I were stopped at the intersection on Highway 9 when a white SUV crashed into the back of her Nissan Rogue. We were both rushed to the hospital where my friend learned that her leg was broken in two places. Paige could not finish the rest of her swim season and was absolutely devastated. We later found out that the driver behind us was looking down at her cell phone and didn't notice that the light had turned red. The driver's one second of distracted driving affected my best friend's life for months although, thankfully, her use of a cell phone did not end it. As a result of the risk to the public, drivers should not be allowed to use handheld cell phones while operating a vehicle.

Operating a vehicle requires attention and focus. Anything that interrupts a driver's concentration leads to a dangerous distraction. Three main types of distracted driving are visual, manual, and cognitive. Drivers who text and drive, snap and drive, instagram and drive, or simply call home while driving are endangering the public. Texting while driving is particularly harmful because it combines all three types of distracted driving . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers who send or read a text while driving lose concentration and take their eyes off the road for up to five seconds. Those five seconds of using a handheld cell phone are a great risk to the public.

Statistics show that using a handheld phone while operating a moving vehicle risks the welfare of the public. In ""Cell Phone Use and Driving,"" Louis Hugo Francescutti states that using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of collisions four to six times, and drivers are twice as often to be in a rear-end collision. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nine people are killed each day, and the public is involved in more than one-thousand car crashes due to distracted driving. Francescutti writes that researchers believe that distracted driving causes twenty-five to ninety percent of car collisions. Clearly, these statistics demonstrate the danger of distracted driving.

Although distracted driving causes over four thousand deaths each year, there are solutions to this tragedy. One obvious solution is not using the phone at all while driving; however, other possible solutions include the use of bluetooth and phone mounts to decrease the number of deaths. Since driving requires attention and focus, making the choice not to use the phone while driving limits the risk to the driver and to the public. When absolutely necessary, the use of bluetooth and phone mounts can offer drivers phone access while still protecting the public. These two alternatives should only be used in case of an emergency.

Clearly, operating a vehicle while using a handheld cell phone is dangerous. Georgia recognized these dangers and passed legislation to prevent the use of handheld devices when driving; however, some drivers fail to follow the law. The driver who caused my accident received a citation for using her device while driving. Hopefully, the next time she goes out on the road she will think about the danger to others and act responsibly.

"Phone & Driving

According to the National Safety Council reports cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. 390,000 injuries occurred caused by cell phone use and driving. Nearly 6,000 pedestrians are killed because of this as well. Phones should not be used while driving not only because the dangers that occur but also because the people that are harmed or killed, and it could've been prevented.

It's rare that the driver ever gets hurt. It's always the person they hit or they've caused a lot of damage. Cell phones are a huge distraction while driving a vehicle. Your not paying attention to the road in front of you because something has caught your eye below the dashboard. Something that could've waited until you arrived at your destination. Sometimes you have to ask yourself is it really that important?

2018 an estimate of 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. Cell phone use while driving resulted in 3,000 to 6,000 people getting killed or injured each year. All because someone couldn't leave their phone leave for awhile. Now they have to deal with people's lawyers and insurance company. Just everything that could've been avoided. Creating unnecessary problems for yourself.

May 29, 2019 a new law was created. It prohibits people driving to not use their cell phones. If a person was to disregard this law. The result would be paying a $50 fine for first offense. That's one way to avoid the dangers and consequences of texting and driving. Another one is to make a mental note for yourself, that the text can wait. The message doesn't have to be answered right way. If it's that important pull over.

You shouldn't text and drive or use your cellular device while behind the wheel. Doing so will result in someone being injured or killed, paying a $50 ticket, or even worse. Don't use your phone while di=riving, it can wait.",1
"There have been an incredible amount of car accident caused by using cell phones while driving. There are about 421,000 people injured in 2017 by an accident caused by people that are described by people that are desecrated by looking at their phone. 1 out of 4 car accident is caused by texting and driving. So in response for the accident with a cellphone the government made new driving laws. In California there is now a law that states you cannot smoke and drive and also edibles even the passenger. Sometime people have different reaction time.

There are new laws that the government have made to put fear in people that like to use their mobile phone while driving.

So that people can stop creating a problem for drivers that use protective driving.

"Phones & Driving

Cell phones have become a key factor in many lives today. People tend to use cell phones for just about any and everything. As a people, we tend to rely on our phones at any given moment. Since the invention of telephones, society has been using phones for texting, talking, social media, etc. For those uses, cell phones have put us at risk. We tend to use or cell phones when we are walking across the street, and most importantly when we are driving. Operating a car while texting/talking results in the driver becoming a hazard to other drivers on the road.

Firstly, there is no doubt that we are addicted to our phones. Our phones have led us to be distracted. A distraction is something that prevents someone from giving their full attention to something else. For instance, when we are driving, we hear our phones ring and instantly we pick it up to answer. It is the inner use telling us that we are amazing drivers, and that one little call will not distract us from the road. In all reality, one little phone call does distract us from when the light changes, or when someone needs to get over to the other lane. Cell phones reduce driving performance.

As well as that, drivers have to operate both the phone and the car, which leads to car accidents. Using the cell phone and driving the car at the same time, reduces the drivers ability to concentrate on the road. All it takes is two seconds to look down at the phone, and the next thing you know, you have caused a life or yours. Car accidents are well known in the community to be caused by texting and driving. Not to mention, being on the phone and driving-slows down reactions to traffic lights and other traffic events, which also causes car accidents. Equally important, during bad weather on slippery road, engaging in conversation equals to paying less attention to the road increasing fatal accidents.

Although, there are negative impacts of texting and driving, it could also be beneficial. The beneficial parts could consists of using it for emergency purposes. For example, calling for assistance on the side of the road, reporting an incident while driving, or simply calling for help. In addition, cell phones can be used for navigation to an unknown destination. Cell phones always provide you with information about news, weather, and alerts for any city you are driving in.

In conclusion,it can be concluded that texting is not only an effective way of communication, but always a safety concern. Different studies have shown that many accidents are caused by phones and driving daily. Phones and driving is a dangerous habit people have picked up on. How many people are going to have to get hurt before realize their actions have consequences? We have to understand that phones and driving is extremely dangerous, and has to be stopped.

"Phones & Driving Essay

Most humans have that habit of attending to their phone when they receive a notification while driving. They are so anxious to know what's going on right there at that moment. But they have no idea of how much danger they are putting themselves & others in! Using a phone while driving can wait. Here's why!

First, you can't multitask & pay attention to both a phone & the road at the same time. If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps.

Second, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So therefore, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that.

Lastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence. Just think about it.

Those are my reasonings for advocating that phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle. It's a high risk & dangerous. But hey, it's just my opinion!",1
"Phones and Driving

Phones have become an essential of human lives, 68% of Americans own smartphones. Some people use it for entertainment and others use it for education and work, but it can also be distracting because people can not put it away even while driving. Nearly 40,000 each year are injured or killed due to a phone caused car crash in the United States. Even though phones can be devastating, they can be used to contact emergency authorities during a crisis on the road, on the other hand they can be hazardous when used for any other reason like calling, texting, or anything else related to looking away from the road.

There is a four second interval between a phone related car crash, a phone rings the driver takes their eyes for at least two seconds to find it, then they answer it before looking back on the road, at this point it can be too late to prevent a fatal crash. The drivers sense of sight, hearing and hand coordination are temporarily lost. Driving is a serious and dangerous task, all attention should be focused on the road, so the individual can drive safely for themselves and other roadway users.

Using your phone while driving is basically like closing your eyes and taking your hands off the wheel. The driver can potentially harm roadway users around them like pedestrians, bikers, truck drivers, and motorcycles. According to the Association for Safe International

Travel, ""Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44.

Each year nearly 400,000 people under 25 die on the world's roads, on average over 1,000 a day."" Many of the crashes could have been prevented if drivers had full attention on the road.

Some of the newer cars are fitted with the handsfree mode where the driver connects their phone through bluetooth. This helps drivers decrease hazards if it is used properly, and there are now cars with autopilot. It helps to put your phone on do not disturb mode or putting it somewhere requiring you to stop and safely use it. Many states are now passing a strict no phone policy in cars, like Georgia if a police see a driver with a phone in their hand they can now be fined.

People have to become more responsible while in the cars, they should always remember to wear seatbelts, use their phone only when there of the road and parked somewhere safe. If used correctly phone can be useful for emergency situation on the road, but they can also be a danger for the individual and other people around them if they are used incorrectly.

"Phones and their impact on driving

Phone use while driving has become extremely common in this day and age. Almost everyone that's driven a car has done it, and they know it. A lot of people do it, but that obviously doesn't make it right. Of course lots of things have come out so that we won't have the phone in our hands while driving, but who said that having a phone in your hand is the only problem? Phones cause for distractions, accidents, and possibly even jail time.

The last thing that you want while driving is to get distracted. I think I could say the same thing for a passenger. Have you ever been in a car with someone and they start looking at their phone?

Have they ever got on the phone and laughed so hard that they close their eyes while driving? It's not a good feeling to be in a situation such as that cause you worry about your life. Hands-free calls are good but just because they don't have a phone in their hand does not mean a person still cannot get distracted due to the use of a phone.

Distraction due to phones could result in multiple things. One of the things it can result in is pedestrians getting hurt. In the state of Georgia, Pedestrians are given the right-of-way when crossing a marked crosswalk. Pedestrians are required to yield the right-of-way to oncoming vehicles when crossing the street without a marked crosswalk. If drivers aren't paying attention then they might just hit a pedestrian and it might just be on the driver. Drivers could be so distracted due to cell phones that they run a stop light and end up hitting a pedestrian.

One of the main reasons for car wrecks in the United States is not driving under the influence or speeding. The main cause for car wrecks in America is distracted driving. People don't realize how easily a person could get in a car wreck. Looking at a text or notification on your phone could take your eyes off the road for almost 5 seconds. 5 seconds doesn't sound like a lot of time but it really doesn't even take a full second for a car wreck to actually happen.

When using your phone while driving, you should ask yourself a few questions. Do I want to possibly go to jail today? Do I want to possibly crash today? Do I want to possibly take a life today? These are questions you should ask yourself before picking up that phone and reading that text or even talking to someone on the phone. Don't be selfish. Think about other people and the impact that using your phone while driving could possibly have on others. Put the phone down and get where you need to go.",1
"PHONES & DRIVING

In today's day and age, technology has drastically increased. People now days seem to rely on their devices more than anything. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They look at the phone while walking, eating at a dinner table, or even in class while their supposed to be learning. But the main problem that is occurring is people texting on their phone while driving an automobile. This brings up the question if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In my perspective, I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving. For starters, you're taking your eyes off the road. This is extremely dangerous because it only takes five seconds (minimal amount) of your time taken away from the road for an extreme accident to occur. For example, if u is driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.",1
"Should People Use Their Cellphones While Driving?

Over the year many states have banned using cellphones while driving. Some people tend not to listen and still use it and that causes a lot of people lives. Should people use their phone while driving? No one should be using their cellphones while driving. It's not safe for you, the person next to you, or the person that you hit, insurance rate goes up, and its illegal.

People thinks that they can use their phones while driving but end up causing people lives even themselves. In 2018 half a million people were injured because of texting and driving. In an article of ""Facts & Statistics About Texting & Driving (Updated for 2018)"" it claims ""With the latest statistics available as of 2018, in 2015, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Transportation, 3,477 people died and another 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes caused by drivers who were distracted because they were texting or using cell phones."" Don't let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the roads.

Depending on what auto insurance people have, when you get into an accident your insurance will go up. In an article ""Just how much does car insurance go up after an accident?"" it said that ""Insurers once followed the Insurance Services Office's (ISO) standard of increasing a premium by 20 to 40 percent of the insurer's base rate after an accident."" If you drive a brand new car that you pay for it, you wouldn't want your insurance to higher then your car bills. Specially if you are a young adult trying to figure things out, you will be making the worst mistake if you let your phone have your attention.

In most state it's illegal to text while driving. There are 41 state that ban texting while driving because of distractions. In the article ""Texting While Driving May Be Common, But It's Illegal In Most States"" it stated,

""In all but four of those states, texting while driving is a primary offense, meaning you can get pulled over and ticketed simply for that alone; in Florida, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio, you can get ticketed for texting only if you were pulled over for some other offense, such as speeding. (By comparison, only 12 states, along with Washington, D.C., ban all drivers from using handheld mobile phones.)"" Don't get distracted and get pulled over because your friends or family is texting you. If anything it only takes a minute to pull over and do what you need to do. You don't want anything to happen to your safety.

Life is too short for anyone to risk it. Witnessing a distracted driver is very scary, life is never promised for tomorrow. Rethink about your choice, is it that important to risk anything? People are way too naive to know what's right from wrong, moral of the story don't text while driving.",1
"Today, there are many controversial conversations on people using their phones while driving. Some People may think that phones should be allowed to be used for certain reasons such as GPS and other emergency uses while others believe that phones should not be used at all due to accidents and law violations. If people were able to use their phones and be a responsible driver at once, just maybe there would not be a problem with it nowadays.

Even though phones have caused a lot of accidents and deaths, I believe that certain uses of the phones should be allowed while driving. Sometimes, people get emergency phone calls and emergency text that they need to see in order to try and fix the situation if it is a fixable situation. Some people also have their phone for uses of GPS and other informational services. Not all people use their phones as a distraction while driving. Some people just need it at the time.

Even though i believe that using your phone while driving is a good idea, there are many cons to this idea. A lot of car accidents had to do with the involvement of teens and adults using their cellular device. Phones have cause a lot of deaths, not just in America but across the world. I believe there should be more laws made that does not ban phones but put restrictions on them like time restrictions. Example: A law that prevents you from using your phone after 8:00 pm or a law that prevents you from using your phone on certain streets.

All in all, i do believe using your phone while driving is not that bad of an idea as long as people can use it responsible while driving.",1
"Cell phones. Almost everyone has them but over the past couple of years have they became a issue where they have caused peoples life's. Many people find the time to be on there phones anywhere at anytime they want including while driving. People have been putting each other in danger just to see a text or a notification while not paying attention to the road this simple action can cause a person to lose there life.

Image a teenage girl first time on the road and is finally able to have her freedom and rights of driving. The girl is driving carefully and responsibly until she gets a notification from her boyfriend saying ""we need to talk"". The girl hesitates to answer the text message while she is looking back and forth from the road to her phone until she finally grabs the phone from the cup holder. She started to text back her boyfriend while running a red light and getting T-boned on her side of the car causing a crash. This is just one of the million possibility's that could happen while texting and driving. This is also a reason as to why under no conditions should a person text while drive. What if the girl didn't pick up the phone? What if instead she turned it off or pulled over onto the side of the road. A text message will be there forever but your life dose not.

Not only are you putting your life at risk but you are also putting other peoples life at risk. For example there's a man driving a truck and just got a text message from his wife he figures that since there is no one on the road nothing bad would happen so while he is texting while driving he dose not notices a boy riding a bike crossing the street he looks up from his phone and realizes whats about to happen and steps on the breaks on time. What if he didn't stop on time what if he kept texting. his actions did not effect him but it effected others such as that little boy. This is why for no reason should you text call or face time while drive it dose not matter how you do it you are still putting other peoples life at stake including your own.

In conclusion drivers should never text while drive because you are then putting your life and others at risk. If only drivers would think before they do something then maybe more people would be alive today. Maybe the girl in the car crash would be alive today maybe the boy riding his bike would be alive today. Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. You are not only driving for yourself but for everybody. A text message can last forever but your life will not.",1
"The use of cars and mobile technology has done nothing but grow in our society without ceasing. However, the use of these cellular devices while driving can be fatal to the driver and to others. If the driver is overly distracted and is not paying attention, it can cause them to veer off the road or hit innocent, bystanding, pedestrians. The use of technology could also be used for good. GPS helps most people on this earth, get to where they need to go. Although, this can also lead to them getting distracted, some apps have it, so that the driver can simply hear the directions. The usage of cellular devices shouldn't be restricted completely, but limited to using GPS.

The amount of car accidents due to drivers being distracted by their phones, is at 1.6 million per year. This is mostly texting and driving, or being on social media while operating a vehicle. Actively using phones while driving should be restricted because of the danger to the driver, passengers, and the pedestrians that are around. Most of the drivers that are making these mistakes, are teenagers that don't know better. Teen drivers, or new drivers in general, should take a proper drivers ed class, that'll teach them proper drivers etiquette. This will inform them of the dangers of texting and driving, and teach them techniques to avoid temptation.

Although the use of cell phones should be restricted, it shouldn't be completely prohibited. Drivers often use their phones for GPS in this day and age. If phones are permanently prohibited, then drivers won't be able to use their mobile map. It navigates the driver to where they need to go. Apps have been programmed so that drivers can use their GPS hands-free. They also input a feature that will speak the directions out loud so the driver doesn't feel the constant need to pick their phone up and read the directions. All the driver has to do is input their destination in before the vehicle starts moving. Phones while driving doesn't need to be prohibited.

Some people will argue that the usage of any phones can start any car accident. While that is true, it is highly unlikely and implausible. Although texting and driving is the cause of many car accidents, it's not the cause for ALL of them. Phones cannot be blamed for every car accident that happens. In fact, drunk driving is the cause for 31% of car accidents that occur in the country. Taking away the cell phone completely from use in the vehicle, will have a poor effect on the drivers who need GPS to go to new places and don't end up lost. It will lead to drivers needing maps, which are often hard to read and hard to keep track of.

Getting rid of cell phone use while driving completely, may seem like a smart idea at first, but it doesn't make sense once really contemplated. It would alter the country's way of driving, and not in a good way. Maybe there would be less accidents, but there are still drunk drivers to worry about. Cell phone usage while driving should not be strictly prohibited, but rather restricted for all uses except for GPS.",1
"Cell phones and vehicle operation are simply two things that do not mix. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Research Shows that using cell phones while driving nearly doubles the risk of a negative outcome occurring. As mediocre as that sounds it could lead to fatal car crashes, Injuring a pedestrian or even punishment for distracted driving.

According to Edgar Snyder & Associates Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". The outcome of texting while driving is not that important to where lives should be taken to send a text if it's that important then why not just pull over. in the article on edgar Snyder & Associates it also states that 10 percent of all teen motor vehicle crash fatalities in 2016 involved distracted driving. The risk is increasing every time a person pulls out there cell phone.

In the article that was posted on USA Today it stated that ""U.S pedestrians death totaled nearly 6,000 in 2017 for the second straight year amid signs that walkers and distracted drivers do not mix.""Also it states that texting while driving is more risky in a urban environments. Teens that text and drive are more likely to get into an accident than an adult that is even though both are risky studies show that being young while doing it is worse than being older while doing it. The issue at hand is affecting everyone texting while driving or just being on your phone is a bad mix and innocent children and adults are suffering because of it.

Texting while driving can result in many punishments like Monetary fines, Criminal charges and jail or prison time. According to Legalmatch ""Texting while driving is a moving traffic violation and may be a criminal misdemeanor in certain jurisdictions"".

Also,Jail or prison time if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. The more you get caught texting and driving the worse the punishment will be it could start off with a simple fine and the next time you could be serving jail time. Finally, If you have been hurt due to someones else mistakes you are entitled to compensation at which you can sue them.

In Conclusion, Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The outcome of this can hurt the drivers mentally, physically and even emotionally (if they take someones life in the process).Texting while driving is now one of the most reason drivers are getting fined as technology advances peoples urge to use their cellphones are growing tremendously. It is not worth it to risk your life for a flash of entertainment that isn't going anywhere anytime soon there actually incorporating technology into the vehicles.

Phones & Driving Essay",1
"Phones & Driving

Driving with a cell phone is very common, yet very dangerous at the same time. This is because phones tend to cause a distraction among, not just teens, but adults as well. Driving with phones have become so crucial, it has become against the law to drive with a phone in hand. The leading cause of teenage deaths in America are car accidents. The fatal crash rate for teens is three times greater than drivers ages twenty and over. Having phone in hand while driving has made for numerous unfortunate deaths for people. The main cause is not being focused on getting to a destined location before picking up a phone. The situation has gotten so severe, the Apple company( made for iPhone), has taken matters into their own hands. They have created 'do not disturb' to detect when a person is in a moving car at certain miles per hour, to keep them from having any distractions as far as notifications or calls.

There have been inventions made to lessen the use of phones while driving, so as the phone holder and using bluetooth connected to a car. Though these things are helpful, it still can be a distraction while driving; as far as maneuvering to answer a call and inserting a phone into a phone holder. Driver distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. After reviewing this information, it's more favorable to not use a cellular device at all whatsoever while behind a wheel. By putting the phone down and taking small steps toward safe driving, even if it takes pulling the car over, will help lower crash/death rates around the globe. In conclusion, phones and driving do not coincide well, and should be prevented no matter what the cause is.
